    74	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    75	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHERE was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night
    76	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied
    77	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it
    78	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought,
    79	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew
    80	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said
    81	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto me: “I am not long for this world,” and I had thought his words idle.
    82	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window
    83	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded
    84	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word
    85	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsimony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some
    86	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to
    87	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.
    88	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    89	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOld Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs
    90	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto supper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if
    91	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treturning to some former remark of his:
    92	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    93	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, I wouldn’t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer ...
    94	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was something uncanny about him. I’ll tell you my opinion....”
    95	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    96	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his
    97	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he used to be rather
    98	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinteresting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him
    99	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand his endless stories about the distillery.
   100	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   101	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I have my own theory about it,” he said. “I think it was one of those
   102	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t... peculiar cases.... But it’s hard to say....”
   103	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   104	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory. My
   105	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncle saw me staring and said to me:
   106	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   107	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, so your old friend is gone, you’ll be sorry to hear.”
   108	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   109	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who?” said I.
   110	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   111	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Father Flynn.”
   112	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   113	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is he dead?”
   114	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   115	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the house.”
   116	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   117	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the news
   118	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad not interested me. My uncle explained to old Cotter.
   119	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   120	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap taught him a
   121	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreat deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him.”
   122	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   123	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God have mercy on his soul,” said my aunt piously.
   124	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   125	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOld Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little beady black
   126	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from my
   127	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplate. He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate.
   128	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   129	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wouldn’t like children of mine,” he said, “to have too much to say to
   130	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta man like that.”
   131	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   132	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How do you mean, Mr Cotter?” asked my aunt.
   133	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   134	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What I mean is,” said old Cotter, “it’s bad for children. My idea is:
   135	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlet a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and
   136	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot be.... Am I right, Jack?”
   137	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   138	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s my principle, too,” said my uncle. “Let him learn to box his
   139	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorner. That’s what I’m always saying to that Rosicrucian there: take
   140	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a cold
   141	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbath, winter and summer. And that’s what stands to me now. Education
   142	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis all very fine and large.... Mr Cotter might take a pick of that leg
   143	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmutton,” he added to my aunt.
   144	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   145	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no, not for me,” said old Cotter.
   146	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   147	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table.
   148	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   149	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But why do you think it’s not good for children, Mr Cotter?” she asked.
   150	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   151	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s bad for children,” said old Cotter, “because their minds are so
   152	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpressionable. When children see things like that, you know, it has an
   153	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teffect....”
   154	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   155	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my
   156	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanger. Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!
   157	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   158	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for
   159	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his
   160	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again
   161	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe heavy grey face of the paralytic. I drew the blankets over my head
   162	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It
   163	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmurmured; and I understood that it desired to confess something. I felt
   164	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and there again
   165	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a murmuring
   166	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so
   167	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis
   168	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac
   169	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his sin.
   170	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   171	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little house
   172	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop, registered under
   173	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe vague name of _Drapery_. The drapery consisted mainly of children’s
   174	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the
   175	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twindow, saying: _Umbrellas Re-covered_. No notice was visible now for
   176	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the door-knocker with
   177	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned
   178	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the crape. I also approached and read:
   179	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   180	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJuly 1st, 1895 The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine’s Church,
   181	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMeath Street), aged sixty-five years. _R. I. P._
   182	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   183	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was
   184	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I would have
   185	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in
   186	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his great-coat. Perhaps
   187	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this
   188	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpresent would have roused him from his stupefied doze. It was always I
   189	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled
   190	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about
   191	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose little
   192	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of his coat.
   193	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient
   194	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpriestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief,
   195	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a week, with which
   196	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite inefficacious.
   197	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   198	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock. I
   199	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all
   200	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe theatrical advertisements in the shopwindows as I went. I found it
   201	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt
   202	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teven annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had
   203	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as my
   204	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal. He had
   205	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstudied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce
   206	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLatin properly. He had told me stories about the catacombs and about
   207	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNapoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of the
   208	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifferent ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn
   209	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult
   210	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquestions to me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances
   211	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only
   212	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timperfections. His questions showed me how complex and mysterious were
   213	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcertain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as
   214	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and
   215	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I
   216	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake
   217	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the
   218	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChurch had written books as thick as the _Post Office Directory_ and
   219	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all
   220	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese intricate questions. Often when I thought of this I could make
   221	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used
   222	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto smile and nod his head twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me
   223	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart;
   224	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now and
   225	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately. When he
   226	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue
   227	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlie upon his lower lip--a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the
   228	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.
   229	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   230	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter’s words and tried
   231	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. I remembered
   232	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique
   233	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfashion. I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the
   234	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcustoms were strange--in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember
   235	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe end of the dream.
   236	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   237	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning.
   238	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked
   239	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds. Nannie
   240	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treceived us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have
   241	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all. The old woman
   242	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt’s nodding, proceeded to
   243	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely
   244	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabove the level of the banister-rail. At the first landing she stopped
   245	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the
   246	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead-room. My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated to
   247	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand.
   248	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   249	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind was
   250	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale
   251	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthin flames. He had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we three
   252	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknelt down at the foot of the bed. I pretended to pray but I could not
   253	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgather my thoughts because the old woman’s mutterings distracted me. I
   254	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the heels
   255	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side. The fancy came to
   256	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin.
   257	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   258	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he
   259	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the
   260	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taltar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice. His face was very
   261	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttruculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled
   262	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room--the flowers.
   263	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   264	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we
   265	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfound Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I groped my way towards my
   266	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tusual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and brought
   267	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses. She set these on the
   268	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable and invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at her
   269	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsister’s bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed
   270	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but I
   271	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeclined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them. She
   272	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly
   273	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke: we all
   274	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgazed at the empty fireplace.
   275	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   276	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:
   277	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   278	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well, he’s gone to a better world.”
   279	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   280	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt fingered the
   281	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstem of her wine-glass before sipping a little.
   282	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   283	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did he ... peacefully?” she asked.
   284	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   285	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Oh, quite peacefully, ma’am,” said Eliza. “You couldn’t tell when the
   286	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath went out of him. He had a beautiful death, God be praised.”
   287	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   288	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And everything...?”
   289	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   290	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Father O’Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and prepared
   291	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim and all.”
   292	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   293	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He knew then?”
   294	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   295	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He was quite resigned.”
   296	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   297	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He looks quite resigned,” said my aunt.
   298	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   299	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s what the woman we had in to wash him said. She said he just
   300	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and resigned. No one
   301	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould think he’d make such a beautiful corpse.”
   302	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   303	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, indeed,” said my aunt.
   304	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   305	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe sipped a little more from her glass and said:
   306	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   307	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to
   308	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow that you did all you could for him. You were both very kind to him,
   309	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI must say.”
   310	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   311	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza smoothed her dress over her knees.
   312	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   313	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, poor James!” she said. “God knows we done all we could, as poor as
   314	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe are--we wouldn’t see him want anything while he was in it.”
   315	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   316	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to
   317	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfall asleep.
   318	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   319	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s poor Nannie,” said Eliza, looking at her, “she’s wore out. All
   320	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash him and then
   321	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in
   322	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe chapel. Only for Father O’Rourke I don’t know what we’d have done
   323	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat all. It was him brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks
   324	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the _Freeman’s General_
   325	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor James’s
   326	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinsurance.”
   327	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   328	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Wasn’t that good of him?” said my aunt.
   329	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   330	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.
   331	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   332	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, there’s no friends like the old friends,” she said, “when all is
   333	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid and done, no friends that a body can trust.”
   334	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   335	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Indeed, that’s true,” said my aunt. “And I’m sure now that he’s gone to
   336	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this eternal reward he won’t forget you and all your kindness to him.”
   337	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   338	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, poor James!” said Eliza. “He was no great trouble to us. You
   339	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldn’t hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I know he’s
   340	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone and all to that....”
   341	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   342	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s when it’s all over that you’ll miss him,” said my aunt.
   343	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   344	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know that,” said Eliza. “I won’t be bringing him in his cup of
   345	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeef-tea any more, nor you, ma’am, sending him his snuff. Ah, poor
   346	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJames!”
   347	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   348	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said
   349	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrewdly:
   350	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   351	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him latterly.
   352	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhenever I’d bring in his soup to him there I’d find him with his
   353	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his mouth
   354	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topen.”
   355	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   356	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she continued:
   357	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   358	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over
   359	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the’d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again
   360	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with
   361	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. If we could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that makes
   362	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno noise that Father O’Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic
   363	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twheels, for the day cheap--he said, at Johnny Rush’s over the way there
   364	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening. He had his
   365	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmind set on that.... Poor James!”
   366	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   367	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Lord have mercy on his soul!” said my aunt.
   368	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   369	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it. Then she put
   370	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some time
   371	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithout speaking.
   372	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   373	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He was too scrupulous always,” she said. “The duties of the priesthood
   374	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas too much for him. And then his life was, you might say, crossed.”
   375	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   376	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said my aunt. “He was a disappointed man. You could see that.”
   377	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   378	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I
   379	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapproached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to
   380	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy chair in the corner. Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery.
   381	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe waited respectfully for her to break the silence: and after a long
   382	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpause she said slowly:
   383	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   384	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it. Of
   385	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean.
   386	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut still.... They say it was the boy’s fault. But poor James was so
   387	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnervous, God be merciful to him!”
   388	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   389	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And was that it?” said my aunt. “I heard something....”
   390	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   391	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza nodded.
   392	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   393	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That affected his mind,” she said. “After that he began to mope by
   394	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself. So one night
   395	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn’t find him anywhere.
   396	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey looked high up and low down; and still they couldn’t see a sight
   397	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof him anywhere. So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So
   398	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father
   399	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to
   400	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook for him.... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by
   401	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like
   402	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoftly to himself?”
   403	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   404	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened; but there was no
   405	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in
   406	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this coffin as we had seen him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle
   407	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchalice on his breast.
   408	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   409	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza resumed:
   410	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   411	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself.... So then, of course, when
   412	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong
   413	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith him....”
   414	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   415	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   416	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   417	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAN ENCOUNTER
   418	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   419	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIT was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a little
   420	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlibrary made up of old numbers of _The Union Jack_, _Pluck_ and _The
   421	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHalfpenny Marvel_. Every evening after school we met in his back garden
   422	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother Leo, the
   423	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tidler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm;
   424	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor we fought a pitched battle on the grass. But, however well we fought,
   425	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe Dillon’s
   426	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twar dance of victory. His parents went to eight-o’clock mass every
   427	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs Dillon was
   428	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprevalent in the hall of the house. But he played too fiercely for us
   429	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho were younger and more timid. He looked like some kind of an Indian
   430	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head, beating a
   431	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttin with his fist and yelling:
   432	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   433	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ya! yaka, yaka, yaka!”
   434	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   435	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation for
   436	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe priesthood. Nevertheless it was true.
   437	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   438	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its
   439	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfluence, differences of culture and constitution were waived. We
   440	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbanded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some almost in
   441	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfear: and of the number of these latter, the reluctant Indians who
   442	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness, I was one. The
   443	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadventures related in the literature of the Wild West were remote from
   444	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy nature but, at least, they opened doors of escape. I liked better
   445	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome American detective stories which were traversed from time to time
   446	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby unkempt fierce and beautiful girls. Though there was nothing wrong
   447	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary
   448	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey were circulated secretly at school. One day when Father Butler was
   449	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thearing the four pages of Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was discovered
   450	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a copy of _The Halfpenny Marvel_.
   451	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   452	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“This page or this page? This page? Now, Dillon, up! _‘Hardly had the
   453	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tday’...._ Go on! What day? _‘Hardly had the day dawned’...._ Have you
   454	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstudied it? What have you there in your pocket?”
   455	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   456	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone’s heart palpitated as Leo Dillon handed up the paper and
   457	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teveryone assumed an innocent face. Father Butler turned over the pages,
   458	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrowning.
   459	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   460	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is this rubbish?” he said. “_The Apache Chief!_ Is this what you
   461	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tread instead of studying your Roman History? Let me not find any more
   462	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof this wretched stuff in this college. The man who wrote it, I suppose,
   463	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas some wretched fellow who writes these things for a drink. I’m
   464	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsurprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff. I could
   465	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderstand it if you were ... National School boys. Now, Dillon, I
   466	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvise you strongly, get at your work or....”
   467	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   468	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of
   469	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Wild West for me and the confused puffy face of Leo Dillon awakened
   470	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone of my consciences. But when the restraining influence of the school
   471	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas at a distance I began to hunger again for wild sensations, for the
   472	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tescape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me. The
   473	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the
   474	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troutine of school in the morning because I wanted real adventures to
   475	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thappen to myself. But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to
   476	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople who remain at home: they must be sought abroad.
   477	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   478	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break
   479	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the weariness of school-life for one day at least. With Leo
   480	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day’s miching. Each of us
   481	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaved up sixpence. We were to meet at ten in the morning on the Canal
   482	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBridge. Mahony’s big sister was to write an excuse for him and Leo
   483	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick. We arranged to go
   484	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the
   485	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House. Leo Dillon was afraid
   486	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe might meet Father Butler or someone out of the college; but Mahony
   487	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked, very sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the
   488	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPigeon House. We were reassured: and I brought the first stage of the
   489	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the
   490	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame time showing them my own sixpence. When we were making the last
   491	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited. We shook hands,
   492	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing, and Mahony said:
   493	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   494	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Till tomorrow, mates!”
   495	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   496	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat night I slept badly. In the morning I was first-comer to the bridge
   497	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas I lived nearest. I hid my books in the long grass near the ashpit at
   498	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried along the canal
   499	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbank. It was a mild sunny morning in the first week of June. I sat up
   500	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas shoes which I had
   501	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the docile horses pulling
   502	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta tramload of business people up the hill. All the branches of the tall
   503	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and
   504	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sunlight slanted through them on to the water. The granite stone of
   505	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bridge was beginning to be warm and I began to pat it with my hands
   506	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin time to an air in my head. I was very happy.
   507	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   508	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen I had been sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw Mahony’s
   509	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrey suit approaching. He came up the hill, smiling, and clambered
   510	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup beside me on the bridge. While we were waiting he brought out
   511	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe catapult which bulged from his inner pocket and explained some
   512	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timprovements which he had made in it. I asked him why he had brought it
   513	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he told me he had brought it to have some gas with the birds. Mahony
   514	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser. We waited
   515	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of Leo
   516	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDillon. Mahony, at last, jumped down and said:
   517	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   518	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come along. I knew Fatty’d funk it.”
   519	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   520	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And his sixpence...?” I said.
   521	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   522	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s forfeit,” said Mahony. “And so much the better for us--a bob and
   523	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta tanner instead of a bob.”
   524	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   525	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the Vitriol Works
   526	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand then turned to the right along the Wharf Road. Mahony began to play
   527	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Indian as soon as we were out of public sight. He chased a crowd
   528	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof ragged girls, brandishing his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged
   529	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we
   530	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshould charge them. I objected that the boys were too small and so
   531	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe walked on, the ragged troop screaming after us: _“Swaddlers!
   532	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSwaddlers!”_ thinking that we were Protestants because Mahony, who was
   533	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap.
   534	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a
   535	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailure because you must have at least three. We revenged ourselves on
   536	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeo Dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would
   537	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget at three o’clock from Mr Ryan.
   538	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   539	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe came then near the river. We spent a long time walking about the
   540	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoisy streets flanked by high stone walls, watching the working of
   541	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the
   542	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrivers of groaning carts. It was noon when we reached the quays and, as
   543	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches, we bought two big
   544	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurrant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside the
   545	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\triver. We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of Dublin’s commerce--the
   546	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbarges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke, the brown
   547	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white sailing-vessel which was
   548	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing discharged on the opposite quay. Mahony said it would be right
   549	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tskit to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even I, looking at
   550	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe high masts, saw, or imagined, the geography which had been scantily
   551	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes. School
   552	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to
   553	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twane.
   554	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   555	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe crossed the Liffey in the ferryboat, paying our toll to be
   556	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttransported in the company of two labourers and a little Jew with a bag.
   557	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe were serious to the point of solemnity, but once during the short
   558	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoyage our eyes met and we laughed. When we landed we watched the
   559	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdischarging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed from the
   560	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother quay. Some bystander said that she was a Norwegian vessel. I went
   561	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but, failing to do
   562	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso, I came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of them
   563	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreen eyes for I had some confused notion.... The sailors’ eyes were
   564	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblue and grey and even black. The only sailor whose eyes could have been
   565	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalled green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay by calling
   566	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout cheerfully every time the planks fell:
   567	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   568	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All right! All right!”
   569	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   570	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into Ringsend. The
   571	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tday had grown sultry, and in the windows of the grocers’ shops musty
   572	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbiscuits lay bleaching. We bought some biscuits and chocolate which
   573	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the
   574	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamilies of the fishermen live. We could find no dairy and so we went
   575	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto a huckster’s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each.
   576	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRefreshed by this, Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped
   577	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto a wide field. We both felt rather tired and when we reached the
   578	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfield we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we
   579	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould see the Dodder.
   580	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   581	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of
   582	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvisiting the Pigeon House. We had to be home before four o’clock lest
   583	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour adventure should be discovered. Mahony looked regretfully at his
   584	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcatapult and I had to suggest going home by train before he regained
   585	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany cheerfulness. The sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our
   586	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions.
   587	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   588	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was nobody but ourselves in the field. When we had lain on the
   589	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbank for some time without speaking I saw a man approaching from the far
   590	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tend of the field. I watched him lazily as I chewed one of those green
   591	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstems on which girls tell fortunes. He came along by the bank slowly. He
   592	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked with one hand upon his hip and in the other hand he held a stick
   593	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith which he tapped the turf lightly. He was shabbily dressed in a suit
   594	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof greenish-black and wore what we used to call a jerry hat with a high
   595	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrown. He seemed to be fairly old for his moustache was ashen-grey. When
   596	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the passed at our feet he glanced up at us quickly and then continued his
   597	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway. We followed him with our eyes and saw that when he had gone on for
   598	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps fifty paces he turned about and began to retrace his steps. He
   599	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked towards us very slowly, always tapping the ground with his stick,
   600	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso slowly that I thought he was looking for something in the grass.
   601	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   602	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stopped when he came level with us and bade us good-day. We answered
   603	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with great care.
   604	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to talk of the weather, saying that it would be a very hot
   605	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsummer and adding that the seasons had changed greatly since he was a
   606	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboy--a long time ago. He said that the happiest time of one’s life was
   607	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tundoubtedly one’s school-boy days and that he would give anything to be
   608	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung again. While he expressed these sentiments which bored us a little
   609	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe kept silent. Then he began to talk of school and of books. He asked
   610	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus whether we had read the poetry of Thomas Moore or the works of Sir
   611	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWalter Scott and Lord Lytton. I pretended that I had read every book he
   612	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmentioned so that in the end he said:
   613	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   614	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, I can see you are a bookworm like myself. Now,” he added, pointing
   615	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, “he is different; he goes
   616	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin for games.”
   617	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   618	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe said he had all Sir Walter Scott’s works and all Lord Lytton’s works
   619	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat home and never tired of reading them. “Of course,” he said, “there
   620	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere some of Lord Lytton’s works which boys couldn’t read.” Mahony asked
   621	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhy couldn’t boys read them--a question which agitated and pained me
   622	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause I was afraid the man would think I was as stupid as Mahony. The
   623	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman, however, only smiled. I saw that he had great gaps in his mouth
   624	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween his yellow teeth. Then he asked us which of us had the most
   625	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsweethearts. Mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties. The man
   626	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked me how many had I. I answered that I had none. He did not believe
   627	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme and said he was sure I must have one. I was silent.
   628	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   629	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell us,” said Mahony pertly to the man, “how many have you yourself?”
   630	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   631	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots
   632	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof sweethearts.
   633	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   634	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Every boy,” he said, “has a little sweetheart.”
   635	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   636	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man
   637	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his age. In my heart I thought that what he said about boys and
   638	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsweethearts was reasonable. But I disliked the words in his mouth and I
   639	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or felt
   640	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta sudden chill. As he proceeded I noticed that his accent was good. He
   641	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair they had
   642	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so good as they
   643	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to be if one only knew. There was nothing he liked, he said, so
   644	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuch as looking at a nice young girl, at her nice white hands and her
   645	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeautiful soft hair. He gave me the impression that he was repeating
   646	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething which he had learned by heart or that, magnetised by some
   647	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twords of his own speech, his mind was slowly circling round and round in
   648	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe same orbit. At times he spoke as if he were simply alluding to some
   649	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfact that everybody knew, and at times he lowered his voice and spoke
   650	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmysteriously as if he were telling us something secret which he did not
   651	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twish others to overhear. He repeated his phrases over and over again,
   652	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvarying them and surrounding them with his monotonous voice. I continued
   653	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto gaze towards the foot of the slope, listening to him.
   654	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   655	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a long while his monologue paused. He stood up slowly, saying
   656	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he had to leave us for a minute or so, a few minutes, and, without
   657	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchanging the direction of my gaze, I saw him walking slowly away from us
   658	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the near end of the field. We remained silent when he had gone.
   659	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a silence of a few minutes I heard Mahony exclaim:
   660	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   661	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I say! Look what he’s doing!”
   662	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   663	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs I neither answered nor raised my eyes Mahony exclaimed again:
   664	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   665	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I say.... He’s a queer old josser!”
   666	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   667	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“In case he asks us for our names,” I said, “let you be Murphy and I’ll
   668	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe Smith.”
   669	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   670	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe said nothing further to each other. I was still considering whether
   671	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us
   672	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain. Hardly had he sat down when Mahony, catching sight of the cat
   673	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich had escaped him, sprang up and pursued her across the field. The
   674	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman and I watched the chase. The cat escaped once more and Mahony began
   675	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto throw stones at the wall she had escaladed. Desisting from this, he
   676	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to wander about the far end of the field, aimlessly.
   677	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   678	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter an interval the man spoke to me. He said that my friend was a very
   679	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school. I was going to
   680	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treply indignantly that we were not National School boys to be whipped,
   681	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he called it; but I remained silent. He began to speak on the subject
   682	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof chastising boys. His mind, as if magnetised again by his speech,
   683	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre. He said that
   684	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen boys were that kind they ought to be whipped and well whipped. When
   685	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him any good but a
   686	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood sound whipping. A slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good:
   687	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping. I was surprised at this
   688	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his face. As I did so I met
   689	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me from under a
   690	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwitching forehead. I turned my eyes away again.
   691	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   692	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man continued his monologue. He seemed to have forgotten his recent
   693	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliberalism. He said that if ever he found a boy talking to girls or
   694	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaving a girl for a sweetheart he would whip him and whip him; and that
   695	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould teach him not to be talking to girls. And if a boy had a girl
   696	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such
   697	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta whipping as no boy ever got in this world. He said that there was
   698	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing in this world he would like so well as that. He described to
   699	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate
   700	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmystery. He would love that, he said, better than anything in this
   701	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld; and his voice, as he led me monotonously through the mystery,
   702	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I should
   703	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderstand him.
   704	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   705	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up abruptly. Lest
   706	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to fix
   707	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go, I bade him
   708	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood-day. I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly
   709	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith fear that he would seize me by the ankles. When I reached the top
   710	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the slope I turned round and, without looking at him, called loudly
   711	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross the field:
   712	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   713	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Murphy!”
   714	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   715	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my
   716	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaltry stratagem. I had to call the name again before Mahony saw me
   717	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand hallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running across the
   718	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfield to me! He ran as if to bring me aid. And I was penitent; for in my
   719	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart I had always despised him a little.
   720	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   721	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   722	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   723	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tARABY
   724	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   725	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNORTH RICHMOND STREET, being blind, was a quiet street except at
   726	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hour when the Christian Brothers’ School set the boys free. An
   727	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from
   728	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street,
   729	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown
   730	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timperturbable faces.
   731	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   732	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back
   733	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all
   734	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old
   735	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuseless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages
   736	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof which were curled and damp: _The Abbot_, by Walter Scott, _The Devout
   737	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCommunicant_ and _The Memoirs of Vidocq_. I liked the last best because
   738	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a
   739	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcentral apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of which
   740	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI found the late tenant’s rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very
   741	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions
   742	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the furniture of his house to his sister.
   743	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   744	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten
   745	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The
   746	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspace of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards
   747	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air
   748	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the
   749	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy
   750	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes
   751	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where
   752	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\todours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a
   753	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled
   754	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tharness. When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows
   755	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in
   756	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister
   757	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea we watched
   758	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see
   759	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our
   760	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshadow and walked up to Mangan’s steps resignedly. She was waiting
   761	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her
   762	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings
   763	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope
   764	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her hair tossed from side to side.
   765	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   766	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door.
   767	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could
   768	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran
   769	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure
   770	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways
   771	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning
   772	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words,
   773	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.
   774	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   775	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On
   776	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry
   777	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome of the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled
   778	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the
   779	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs’
   780	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a _come-all-you_
   781	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout O’Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native
   782	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tland. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I
   783	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her
   784	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I
   785	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmyself did not understand. My eyes were often full of tears (I could not
   786	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttell why) and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out
   787	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto my bosom. I thought little of the future. I did not know whether I
   788	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell
   789	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp and her words
   790	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.
   791	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   792	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had
   793	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdied. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house.
   794	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThrough one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth,
   795	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds. Some
   796	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I
   797	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves
   798	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms of
   799	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy hands together until they trembled, murmuring: _“O love! O love!”_
   800	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmany times.
   801	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   802	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was
   803	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I
   804	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoing to _Araby_. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a
   805	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsplendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go.
   806	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   807	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And why can’t you?” I asked.
   808	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   809	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist.
   810	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week
   811	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their
   812	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaps and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing
   813	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught
   814	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and,
   815	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfalling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of her
   816	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she
   817	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood at ease.
   818	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   819	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s well for you,” she said.
   820	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   821	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If I go,” I said, “I will bring you something.”
   822	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   823	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts
   824	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days.
   825	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day
   826	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to
   827	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tread. The syllables of the word _Araby_ were called to me through the
   828	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over
   829	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt
   830	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas surprised and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I answered few
   831	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquestions in class. I watched my master’s face pass from amiability to
   832	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my
   833	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with the serious
   834	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twork of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed
   835	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto me child’s play, ugly monotonous child’s play.
   836	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   837	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the
   838	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the
   839	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\that-brush, and answered me curtly:
   840	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   841	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, boy, I know.”
   842	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   843	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at
   844	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe window. I left the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the
   845	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.
   846	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   847	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was
   848	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tearly. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking
   849	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and
   850	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgained the upper part of the house. The high cold empty gloomy rooms
   851	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window
   852	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me
   853	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass,
   854	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood
   855	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my
   856	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at
   857	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.
   858	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   859	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire.
   860	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker’s widow, who collected
   861	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the
   862	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did
   863	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn’t wait any
   864	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlonger, but it was after eight o’clock and she did not like to be out
   865	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlate as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to walk
   866	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:
   867	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   868	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.”
   869	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   870	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the halldoor. I heard him
   871	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received
   872	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was
   873	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmidway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the
   874	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbazaar. He had forgotten.
   875	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   876	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,” he said.
   877	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   878	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:
   879	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   880	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Can’t you give him the money and let him go? You’ve kept him late
   881	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenough as it is.”
   882	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   883	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in
   884	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe old saying: “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” He asked
   885	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme where I was going and, when I had told him a second time he asked me
   886	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid I know _The Arab’s Farewell to his Steed_. When I left the kitchen
   887	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.
   888	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   889	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street
   890	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and
   891	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my
   892	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After an intolerable
   893	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among
   894	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\truinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station
   895	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved
   896	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar. I remained
   897	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an
   898	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timprovised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the
   899	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me
   900	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a large building which displayed the magical name.
   901	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   902	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar
   903	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a
   904	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girdled at
   905	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalf its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the
   906	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreater part of the hall was in darkness. I recognised a silence like
   907	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the centre
   908	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls which
   909	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere still open. Before a curtain, over which the words _Café Chantant_
   910	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver.
   911	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI listened to the fall of the coins.
   912	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   913	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRemembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to one of the
   914	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the
   915	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young
   916	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentlemen. I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to
   917	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir conversation.
   918	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   919	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I never said such a thing!”
   920	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   921	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, but you did!”
   922	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   923	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, but I didn’t!”
   924	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   925	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Didn’t she say that?”
   926	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   927	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. I heard her.”
   928	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   929	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, there’s a ... fib!”
   930	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   931	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tObserving me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy
   932	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have
   933	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars
   934	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to
   935	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stall and murmured:
   936	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   937	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, thank you.”
   938	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   939	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to
   940	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice
   941	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe young lady glanced at me over her shoulder.
   942	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   943	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make
   944	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly
   945	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to
   946	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one
   947	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tend of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall
   948	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas now completely dark.
   949	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   950	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and
   951	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tderided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.
   952	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   953	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   954	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   955	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEVELINE
   956	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   957	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSHE sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head
   958	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour
   959	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof dusty cretonne. She was tired.
   960	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   961	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFew people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way
   962	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and
   963	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One
   964	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime there used to be a field there in which they used to play every
   965	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening with other people’s children. Then a man from Belfast bought
   966	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe field and built houses in it--not like their little brown houses but
   967	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used
   968	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto play together in that field--the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns,
   969	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest,
   970	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thowever, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to
   971	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually
   972	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father
   973	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was
   974	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time
   975	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother
   976	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to
   977	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEngland. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the
   978	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers, to leave her home.
   979	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   980	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHome! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects
   981	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on
   982	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tearth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again those
   983	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamiliar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided.
   984	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the
   985	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpriest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken
   986	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tharmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed
   987	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMargaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her father.
   988	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass
   989	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit with a casual word:
   990	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   991	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He is in Melbourne now.”
   992	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   993	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She
   994	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttried to weigh each side of the question. In her home anyway she had
   995	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about
   996	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther. Of course she had to work hard, both in the house and at business.
   997	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she
   998	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad run away with a fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place
   999	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She
  1000	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people
  1001	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistening.
  1002	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1003	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Hill, don’t you see these ladies are waiting?”
  1004	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1005	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Look lively, Miss Hill, please.”
  1006	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1007	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores.
  1008	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1009	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like
  1010	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat. Then she would be married--she, Eveline. People would treat her
  1011	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been. Even
  1012	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger
  1013	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her father’s violence. She knew it was that that had given her the
  1014	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpalpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for her like
  1015	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl; but latterly
  1016	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for
  1017	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther dead mother’s sake. And now she had nobody to protect her. Ernest
  1018	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was
  1019	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnearly always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable
  1020	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsquabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her
  1021	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunspeakably. She always gave her entire wages--seven shillings--and
  1022	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHarry always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money
  1023	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom her father. He said she used to squander the money, that she had
  1024	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno head, that he wasn’t going to give her his hard-earned money to throw
  1025	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad of a
  1026	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaturday night. In the end he would give her the money and ask her had
  1027	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe any intention of buying Sunday’s dinner. Then she had to rush out
  1028	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather
  1029	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpurse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and
  1030	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treturning home late under her load of provisions. She had hard work to
  1031	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkeep the house together and to see that the two young children who had
  1032	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals
  1033	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tregularly. It was hard work--a hard life--but now that she was about to
  1034	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life.
  1035	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1036	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind,
  1037	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him by the night-boat to
  1038	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home
  1039	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaiting for her. How well she remembered the first time she had seen
  1040	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit.
  1041	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt seemed a few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap
  1042	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a face of
  1043	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbronze. Then they had come to know each other. He used to meet her
  1044	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutside the Stores every evening and see her home. He took her to see
  1045	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_The Bohemian Girl_ and she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed
  1046	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpart of the theatre with him. He was awfully fond of music and sang a
  1047	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle. People knew that they were courting and, when he sang about the
  1048	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlass that loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly confused. He used
  1049	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement
  1050	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him. He had
  1051	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttales of distant countries. He had started as a deck boy at a pound a
  1052	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmonth on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada. He told her
  1053	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different
  1054	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tservices. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her
  1055	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos
  1056	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAyres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday.
  1057	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to
  1058	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave anything to say to him.
  1059	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1060	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know these sailor chaps,” he said.
  1061	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1062	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her
  1063	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlover secretly.
  1064	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1065	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap
  1066	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest
  1067	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming
  1068	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very
  1069	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read
  1070	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day,
  1071	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill
  1072	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother’s bonnet to
  1073	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmake the children laugh.
  1074	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1075	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer time was running out but she continued to sit by the window,
  1076	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty
  1077	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing.
  1078	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night to remind
  1079	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together
  1080	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas long as she could. She remembered the last night of her mother’s
  1081	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tillness; she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the
  1082	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ-player
  1083	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She remembered her
  1084	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather strutting back into the sickroom saying:
  1085	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1086	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Damned Italians! coming over here!”
  1087	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1088	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs she mused the pitiful vision of her mother’s life laid its spell on
  1089	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe very quick of her being--that life of commonplace sacrifices closing
  1090	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother’s voice
  1091	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaying constantly with foolish insistence:
  1092	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1093	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!”
  1094	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1095	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape!
  1096	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But she
  1097	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to happiness.
  1098	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He would save
  1099	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther.
  1100	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1101	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1102	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1103	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He
  1104	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying something
  1105	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout the passage over and over again. The station was full of soldiers
  1106	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith brown baggages. Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a
  1107	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall,
  1108	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her cheek pale
  1109	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God to direct
  1110	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a long mournful
  1111	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she would be on the sea
  1112	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had been
  1113	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbooked. Could she still draw back after all he had done for her? Her
  1114	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in
  1115	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent fervent prayer.
  1116	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1117	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:
  1118	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1119	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come!”
  1120	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1121	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her
  1122	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron
  1123	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trailing.
  1124	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1125	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come!”
  1126	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1127	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy.
  1128	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAmid the seas she sent a cry of anguish!
  1129	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1130	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Eveline! Evvy!”
  1131	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1132	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was shouted
  1133	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat to go on but he still called to her. She set her white face to him,
  1134	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of love or
  1135	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfarewell or recognition.
  1136	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1137	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1138	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1139	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAFTER THE RACE
  1140	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1141	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE cars came scudding in towards Dublin, running evenly like pellets
  1142	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the groove of the Naas Road. At the crest of the hill at Inchicore
  1143	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward
  1144	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its
  1145	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twealth and industry. Now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer
  1146	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the gratefully oppressed. Their sympathy, however, was for the blue
  1147	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcars--the cars of their friends, the French.
  1148	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1149	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe French, moreover, were virtual victors. Their team had finished
  1150	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsolidly; they had been placed second and third and the driver of the
  1151	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twinning German car was reported a Belgian. Each blue car, therefore,
  1152	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treceived a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill
  1153	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those
  1154	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the car. In one of these trimly built cars was a party of four
  1155	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level
  1156	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof successful Gallicism: in fact, these four young men were almost
  1157	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thilarious. They were Charles Ségouin, the owner of the car; André
  1158	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRivière, a young electrician of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named
  1159	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVillona and a neatly groomed young man named Doyle. Ségouin was in good
  1160	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thumour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance (he
  1161	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas about to start a motor establishment in Paris) and Rivière was in
  1162	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment;
  1163	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese two young men (who were cousins) were also in good humour because
  1164	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the success of the French cars. Villona was in good humour because he
  1165	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides he was an optimist by
  1166	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnature. The fourth member of the party, however, was too excited to be
  1167	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgenuinely happy.
  1168	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1169	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was about twenty-six years of age, with a soft, light brown moustache
  1170	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand rather innocent-looking grey eyes. His father, who had begun life as
  1171	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan advanced Nationalist, had modified his views early. He had made his
  1172	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney as a butcher in Kingstown and by opening shops in Dublin and in
  1173	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe suburbs he had made his money many times over. He had also been
  1174	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end
  1175	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had become rich enough to be alluded to in the Dublin newspapers as a
  1176	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmerchant prince. He had sent his son to England to be educated in a big
  1177	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCatholic college and had afterwards sent him to Dublin University to
  1178	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstudy law. Jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses
  1179	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a while. He had money and he was popular; and he divided his time
  1180	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcuriously between musical and motoring circles. Then he had been sent
  1181	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a term to Cambridge to see a little life. His father, remonstrative,
  1182	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut covertly proud of the excess, had paid his bills and brought him
  1183	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome. It was at Cambridge that he had met Ségouin. They were not much
  1184	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore than acquaintances as yet but Jimmy found great pleasure in the
  1185	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsociety of one who had seen so much of the world and was reputed to
  1186	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\town some of the biggest hotels in France. Such a person (as his father
  1187	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagreed) was well worth knowing, even if he had not been the charming
  1188	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompanion he was. Villona was entertaining also--a brilliant
  1189	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpianist--but, unfortunately, very poor.
  1190	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1191	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth. The two
  1192	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcousins sat on the front seat; Jimmy and his Hungarian friend sat
  1193	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbehind. Decidedly Villona was in excellent spirits; he kept up a deep
  1194	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbass hum of melody for miles of the road. The Frenchmen flung their
  1195	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughter and light words over their shoulders and often Jimmy had
  1196	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto strain forward to catch the quick phrase. This was not altogether
  1197	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasant for him, as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the
  1198	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind.
  1199	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBesides Villona’s humming would confuse anybody; the noise of the car,
  1200	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo.
  1201	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1202	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRapid motion through space elates one; so does notoriety; so does
  1203	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe possession of money. These were three good reasons for Jimmy’s
  1204	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcitement. He had been seen by many of his friends that day in the
  1205	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompany of these Continentals. At the control Ségouin had presented him
  1206	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto one of the French competitors and, in answer to his confused murmur
  1207	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof compliment, the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of
  1208	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshining white teeth. It was pleasant after that honour to return to the
  1209	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprofane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks. Then
  1210	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas to money--he really had a great sum under his control. Ségouin,
  1211	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps, would not think it a great sum but Jimmy who, in spite of
  1212	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttemporary errors, was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew
  1213	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell with what difficulty it had been got together. This knowledge had
  1214	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpreviously kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness,
  1215	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, if he had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when
  1216	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence,
  1217	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow much more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his
  1218	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubstance! It was a serious thing for him.
  1219	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1220	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course, the investment was a good one and Ségouin had managed to
  1221	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgive the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the mite of
  1222	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIrish money was to be included in the capital of the concern. Jimmy had
  1223	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta respect for his father’s shrewdness in business matters and in this
  1224	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase it had been his father who had first suggested the investment;
  1225	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney to be made in the motor business, pots of money. Moreover Ségouin
  1226	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad the unmistakable air of wealth. Jimmy set out to translate into
  1227	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays’ work that lordly car in which he sat. How smoothly it ran. In what
  1228	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstyle they had come careering along the country roads! The journey
  1229	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the
  1230	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmachinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the
  1231	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswift blue animal.
  1232	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1233	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey drove down Dame Street. The street was busy with unusual
  1234	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttraffic, loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient
  1235	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram-drivers. Near the Bank Ségouin drew up and Jimmy and his friend
  1236	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talighted. A little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay
  1237	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thomage to the snorting motor. The party was to dine together that
  1238	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening in Ségouin’s hotel and, meanwhile, Jimmy and his friend, who
  1239	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas staying with him, were to go home to dress. The car steered out
  1240	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslowly for Grafton Street while the two young men pushed their way
  1241	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the knot of gazers. They walked northward with a curious feeling
  1242	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof disappointment in the exercise, while the city hung its pale globes
  1243	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof light above them in a haze of summer evening.
  1244	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1245	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn Jimmy’s house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion. A certain
  1246	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpride mingled with his parents’ trepidation, a certain eagerness, also,
  1247	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at
  1248	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleast this virtue. Jimmy, too, looked very well when he was dressed and,
  1249	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his dress
  1250	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttie, his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having
  1251	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable. His father,
  1252	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttherefore, was unusually friendly with Villona and his manner expressed
  1253	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta real respect for foreign accomplishments; but this subtlety of his
  1254	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thost was probably lost upon the Hungarian, who was beginning to have a
  1255	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsharp desire for his dinner.
  1256	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1257	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe dinner was excellent, exquisite. Ségouin, Jimmy decided, had a very
  1258	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trefined taste. The party was increased by a young Englishman named Routh
  1259	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhom Jimmy had seen with Ségouin at Cambridge. The young men supped in
  1260	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta snug room lit by electric candle-lamps. They talked volubly and with
  1261	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle reserve. Jimmy, whose imagination was kindling, conceived the
  1262	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlively youth of the Frenchmen twined elegantly upon the firm framework
  1263	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Englishman’s manner. A graceful image of his, he thought, and a
  1264	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust one. He admired the dexterity with which their host directed the
  1265	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconversation. The five young men had various tastes and their tongues
  1266	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been loosened. Villona, with immense respect, began to discover to
  1267	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe mildly surprised Englishman the beauties of the English madrigal,
  1268	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeploring the loss of old instruments. Rivière, not wholly ingenuously,
  1269	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tundertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the French mechanicians.
  1270	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe resonant voice of the Hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of
  1271	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe spurious lutes of the romantic painters when Ségouin shepherded
  1272	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this party into politics. Here was congenial ground for all. Jimmy, under
  1273	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgenerous influences, felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life
  1274	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithin him: he aroused the torpid Routh at last. The room grew doubly
  1275	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thot and Ségouin’s task grew harder each moment: there was even danger
  1276	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof personal spite. The alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass
  1277	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Humanity and, when the toast had been drunk, he threw open a window
  1278	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsignificantly.
  1279	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1280	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men
  1281	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrolled along Stephen’s Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They
  1282	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders.
  1283	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short
  1284	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another
  1285	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the
  1286	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparty.
  1287	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1288	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“André.”
  1289	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1290	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s Farley!”
  1291	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1292	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very
  1293	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell what the talk was about. Villona and Rivière were the noisiest,
  1294	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves
  1295	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd, blended now into
  1296	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the train at Westland
  1297	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRow and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out
  1298	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he was an old
  1299	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman:
  1300	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1301	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Fine night, sir!”
  1302	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1303	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at
  1304	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing _Cadet
  1305	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRoussel_ in chorus, stamping their feet at every:
  1306	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1307	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_“Ho! Ho! Hohé, vraiment!”_
  1308	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1309	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American’s
  1310	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with
  1311	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconviction:
  1312	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1313	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It is delightful!”
  1314	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1315	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley
  1316	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Rivière, Farley acting as cavalier and Rivière as lady. Then
  1317	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What
  1318	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmerriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at
  1319	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleast. Then Farley got out of breath and cried _“Stop!”_ A man brought
  1320	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form’s sake.
  1321	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England,
  1322	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrance, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a
  1323	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong speech, Villona saying: _“Hear! hear!”_ whenever there was a pause.
  1324	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must have been
  1325	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta good speech. Farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly. What
  1326	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjovial fellows! What good company they were!
  1327	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1328	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCards! cards! The table was cleared. Villona returned quietly to his
  1329	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpiano and played voluntaries for them. The other men played game after
  1330	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgame, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure. They drank the
  1331	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thealth of the Queen of Hearts and of the Queen of Diamonds. Jimmy felt
  1332	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was flashing. Play ran very
  1333	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh and paper began to pass. Jimmy did not know exactly who was
  1334	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twinning but he knew that he was losing. But it was his own fault for
  1335	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the frequently mistook his cards and the other men had to calculate his
  1336	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI.O.U.’s for him. They were devils of fellows but he wished they would
  1337	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstop: it was getting late. Someone gave the toast of the yacht _The
  1338	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBelle of Newport_ and then someone proposed one great game for a finish.
  1339	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1340	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe piano had stopped; Villona must have gone up on deck. It was a
  1341	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterrible game. They stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck.
  1342	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJimmy understood that the game lay between Routh and Ségouin. What
  1343	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcitement! Jimmy was excited too; he would lose, of course. How much
  1344	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad he written away? The men rose to their feet to play the last tricks.
  1345	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking and gesticulating. Routh won. The cabin shook with the young
  1346	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmen’s cheering and the cards were bundled together. They began then to
  1347	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgather in what they had won. Farley and Jimmy were the heaviest losers.
  1348	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1349	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad
  1350	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly. He
  1351	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands,
  1352	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounting the beats of his temples. The cabin door opened and he saw the
  1353	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHungarian standing in a shaft of grey light:
  1354	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1355	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Daybreak, gentlemen!”
  1356	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1357	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1358	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1359	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTWO GALLANTS
  1360	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1361	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE grey warm evening of August had descended upon the city and a mild
  1362	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twarm air, a memory of summer, circulated in the streets. The streets,
  1363	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed with a gaily coloured crowd.
  1364	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLike illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their tall
  1365	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoles upon the living texture below which, changing shape and hue
  1366	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunceasingly, sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging
  1367	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunceasing murmur.
  1368	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1369	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. One of them was just
  1370	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbringing a long monologue to a close. The other, who walked on the verge
  1371	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road, owing to
  1372	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this companion’s rudeness, wore an amused listening face. He was squat
  1373	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand ruddy. A yachting cap was shoved far back from his forehead and the
  1374	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnarrative to which he listened made constant waves of expression break
  1375	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforth over his face from the corners of his nose and eyes and mouth.
  1376	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle jets of wheezing laughter followed one another out of his
  1377	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconvulsed body. His eyes, twinkling with cunning enjoyment, glanced at
  1378	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery moment towards his companion’s face. Once or twice he rearranged
  1379	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe light waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in toreador
  1380	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfashion. His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his jauntily slung
  1381	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaterproof expressed youth. But his figure fell into rotundity at the
  1382	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaist, his hair was scant and grey and his face, when the waves of
  1383	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpression had passed over it, had a ravaged look.
  1384	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1385	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed
  1386	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he said:
  1387	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1388	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well!... That takes the biscuit!”
  1389	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1390	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he added
  1391	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith humour:
  1392	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1393	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it, _recherché_
  1394	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbiscuit!”
  1395	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1396	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe became serious and silent when he had said this. His tongue was tired
  1397	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor he had been talking all the afternoon in a public-house in Dorset
  1398	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStreet. Most people considered Lenehan a leech but, in spite of this
  1399	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treputation, his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his
  1400	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriends from forming any general policy against him. He had a brave
  1401	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself
  1402	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round.
  1403	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks
  1404	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand riddles. He was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy. No one
  1405	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew how he achieved the stern task of living, but his name was vaguely
  1406	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassociated with racing tissues.
  1407	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1408	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And where did you pick her up, Corley?” he asked.
  1409	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1410	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip.
  1411	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1412	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“One night, man,” he said, “I was going along Dame Street and I spotted
  1413	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta fine tart under Waterhouse’s clock and said good-night, you know. So
  1414	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a slavey
  1415	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a house in Baggot Street. I put my arm round her and squeezed her a
  1416	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbit that night. Then next Sunday, man, I met her by appointment. We went
  1417	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout to Donnybrook and I brought her into a field there. She told me she
  1418	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused to go with a dairyman.... It was fine, man. Cigarettes every night
  1419	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe’d bring me and paying the tram out and back. And one night she
  1420	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought me two bloody fine cigars--O, the real cheese, you know, that
  1421	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe old fellow used to smoke.... I was afraid, man, she’d get in the
  1422	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamily way. But she’s up to the dodge.”
  1423	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1424	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Maybe she thinks you’ll marry her,” said Lenehan.
  1425	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1426	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I told her I was out of a job,” said Corley. “I told her I was in
  1427	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPim’s. She doesn’t know my name. I was too hairy to tell her that. But
  1428	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe thinks I’m a bit of class, you know.”
  1429	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1430	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan laughed again, noiselessly.
  1431	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1432	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of all the good ones ever I heard,” he said, “that emphatically takes
  1433	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe biscuit.”
  1434	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1435	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley’s stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body
  1436	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway
  1437	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had
  1438	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinherited his father’s frame and gait. He walked with his hands by his
  1439	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side. His
  1440	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thead was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his
  1441	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlarge round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had
  1442	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrown out of another. He always stared straight before him as if he were
  1443	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it
  1444	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was
  1445	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to
  1446	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgive him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen
  1447	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all
  1448	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without
  1449	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly
  1450	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout himself: what he had said to such a person and what such a person
  1451	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he
  1452	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after
  1453	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe manner of Florentines.
  1454	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1455	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on
  1456	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the
  1457	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassing girls but Lenehan’s gaze was fixed on the large faint moon
  1458	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcircled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey
  1459	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweb of twilight across its face. At length he said:
  1460	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1461	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well ... tell me, Corley, I suppose you’ll be able to pull it off all
  1462	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright, eh?”
  1463	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1464	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley closed one eye expressively as an answer.
  1465	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1466	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is she game for that?” asked Lenehan dubiously. “You can never know
  1467	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomen.”
  1468	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1469	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s all right,” said Corley. “I know the way to get around her, man.
  1470	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe’s a bit gone on me.”
  1471	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1472	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’re what I call a gay Lothario,” said Lenehan. “And the proper kind
  1473	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a Lothario, too!”
  1474	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1475	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save himself
  1476	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of
  1477	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\traillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.
  1478	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1479	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s nothing to touch a good slavey,” he affirmed. “Take my tip for
  1480	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit.”
  1481	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1482	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“By one who has tried them all,” said Lenehan.
  1483	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1484	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“First I used to go with girls, you know,” said Corley, unbosoming;
  1485	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“girls off the South Circular. I used to take them out, man, on the
  1486	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the
  1487	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way. I used
  1488	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto spend money on them right enough,” he added, in a convincing tone, as
  1489	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif he was conscious of being disbelieved.
  1490	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1491	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely.
  1492	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1493	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know that game,” he said, “and it’s a mug’s game.”
  1494	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1495	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And damn the thing I ever got out of it,” said Corley.
  1496	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1497	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ditto here,” said Lenehan.
  1498	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1499	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Only off of one of them,” said Corley.
  1500	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1501	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it. The
  1502	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecollection brightened his eyes. He too gazed at the pale disc of the
  1503	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate.
  1504	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1505	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She was ... a bit of all right,” he said regretfully.
  1506	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1507	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was silent again. Then he added:
  1508	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1509	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street one night
  1510	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith two fellows with her on a car.”
  1511	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1512	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I suppose that’s your doing,” said Lenehan.
  1513	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1514	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There was others at her before me,” said Corley philosophically.
  1515	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1516	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He shook his head to and
  1517	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfro and smiled.
  1518	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1519	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You know you can’t kid me, Corley,” he said.
  1520	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1521	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Honest to God!” said Corley. “Didn’t she tell me herself?”
  1522	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1523	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan made a tragic gesture.
  1524	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1525	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Base betrayer!” he said.
  1526	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1527	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan skipped
  1528	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout into the road and peered up at the clock.
  1529	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1530	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Twenty after,” he said.
  1531	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1532	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Time enough,” said Corley. “She’ll be there all right. I always let her
  1533	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twait a bit.”
  1534	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1535	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan laughed quietly.
  1536	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1537	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ecod! Corley, you know how to take them,” he said.
  1538	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1539	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m up to all their little tricks,” Corley confessed.
  1540	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1541	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But tell me,” said Lenehan again, “are you sure you can bring it off
  1542	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall right? You know it’s a ticklish job. They’re damn close on that
  1543	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoint. Eh?... What?”
  1544	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1545	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis bright, small eyes searched his companion’s face for reassurance.
  1546	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent
  1547	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinsect, and his brows gathered.
  1548	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1549	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll pull it off,” he said. “Leave it to me, can’t you?”
  1550	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1551	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan said no more. He did not wish to ruffle his friend’s temper, to
  1552	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted. A little
  1553	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttact was necessary. But Corley’s brow was soon smooth again. His
  1554	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthoughts were running another way.
  1555	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1556	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s a fine decent tart,” he said, with appreciation; “that’s what she
  1557	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis.”
  1558	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1559	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare Street. Not
  1560	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfar from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway, playing
  1561	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto a little ring of listeners. He plucked at the wires heedlessly,
  1562	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglancing quickly from time to time at the face of each new-comer and
  1563	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom time to time, wearily also, at the sky. His harp, too, heedless
  1564	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat her coverings had fallen about her knees, seemed weary alike of the
  1565	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes of strangers and of her master’s hands. One hand played in the bass
  1566	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe melody of _Silent, O Moyle_, while the other hand careered in the
  1567	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttreble after each group of notes. The notes of the air sounded deep and
  1568	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull.
  1569	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1570	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe two young men walked up the street without speaking, the mournful
  1571	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusic following them. When they reached Stephen’s Green they crossed the
  1572	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troad. Here the noise of trams, the lights and the crowd released them
  1573	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom their silence.
  1574	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1575	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There she is!” said Corley.
  1576	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1577	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing. She wore a blue
  1578	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdress and a white sailor hat. She stood on the curbstone, swinging a
  1579	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsunshade in one hand. Lenehan grew lively.
  1580	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1581	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Let’s have a look at her, Corley,” he said.
  1582	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1583	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on
  1584	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this face.
  1585	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1586	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you trying to get inside me?” he asked.
  1587	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1588	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Damn it!” said Lenehan boldly, “I don’t want an introduction. All I
  1589	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twant is to have a look at her. I’m not going to eat her.”
  1590	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1591	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O.... A look at her?” said Corley, more amiably. “Well ... I’ll tell
  1592	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou what. I’ll go over and talk to her and you can pass by.”
  1593	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1594	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Right!” said Lenehan.
  1595	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1596	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley had already thrown one leg over the chains when Lenehan called
  1597	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout:
  1598	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1599	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And after? Where will we meet?”
  1600	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1601	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Half ten,” answered Corley, bringing over his other leg.
  1602	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1603	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where?”
  1604	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1605	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Corner of Merrion Street. We’ll be coming back.”
  1606	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1607	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Work it all right now,” said Lenehan in farewell.
  1608	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1609	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley did not answer. He sauntered across the road swaying his head
  1610	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom side to side. His bulk, his easy pace, and the solid sound of his
  1611	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboots had something of the conqueror in them. He approached the young
  1612	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her. She
  1613	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels.
  1614	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOnce or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and
  1615	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbent her head.
  1616	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1617	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan observed them for a few minutes. Then he walked rapidly along
  1618	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely. As he
  1619	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapproached Hume Street corner he found the air heavily scented and his
  1620	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman’s appearance. She
  1621	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad her Sunday finery on. Her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by
  1622	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta belt of black leather. The great silver buckle of her belt seemed to
  1623	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdepress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of her white
  1624	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblouse like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl
  1625	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of her tulle collarette had
  1626	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in
  1627	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther bosom, stems upwards. Lenehan’s eyes noted approvingly her stout
  1628	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshort muscular body. Frank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat
  1629	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tred cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her features were blunt. She
  1630	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented
  1631	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleer, and two projecting front teeth. As he passed Lenehan took off his
  1632	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcap and, after about ten seconds, Corley returned a salute to the air.
  1633	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle
  1634	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof position of his hat.
  1635	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1636	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan walked as far as the Shelbourne Hotel where he halted and
  1637	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaited. After waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him
  1638	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, when they turned to the right, he followed them, stepping lightly
  1639	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin his white shoes, down one side of Merrion Square. As he walked on
  1640	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslowly, timing his pace to theirs, he watched Corley’s head which turned
  1641	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat every moment towards the young woman’s face like a big ball revolving
  1642	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton a pivot. He kept the pair in view until he had seen them climbing the
  1643	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs of the Donnybrook tram; then he turned about and went back the
  1644	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway he had come.
  1645	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1646	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow that he was alone his face looked older. His gaiety seemed to
  1647	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforsake him and, as he came by the railings of the Duke’s Lawn, he
  1648	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallowed his hand to run along them. The air which the harpist had played
  1649	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to control his movements. His softly padded feet played the melody
  1650	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile his fingers swept a scale of variations idly along the railings
  1651	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter each group of notes.
  1652	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1653	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked listlessly round Stephen’s Green and then down Grafton Street.
  1654	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThough his eyes took note of many elements of the crowd through which
  1655	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the passed they did so morosely. He found trivial all that was meant to
  1656	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharm him and did not answer the glances which invited him to be bold.
  1657	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe knew that he would have to speak a great deal, to invent and to
  1658	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamuse, and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task. The
  1659	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproblem of how he could pass the hours till he met Corley again troubled
  1660	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim a little. He could think of no way of passing them but to keep on
  1661	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking. He turned to the left when he came to the corner of Rutland
  1662	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSquare and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street, the sombre look
  1663	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof which suited his mood. He paused at last before the window of a
  1664	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoor-looking shop over which the words _Refreshment Bar_ were printed in
  1665	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhite letters. On the glass of the window were two flying inscriptions:
  1666	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Ginger Beer_ and _Ginger Ale_. A cut ham was exposed on a great blue
  1667	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdish while near it on a plate lay a segment of very light plum-pudding.
  1668	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe eyed this food earnestly for some time and then, after glancing
  1669	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twarily up and down the street, went into the shop quickly.
  1670	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1671	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was hungry for, except some biscuits which he had asked two grudging
  1672	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurates to bring him, he had eaten nothing since breakfast-time. He
  1673	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsat down at an uncovered wooden table opposite two work-girls and a
  1674	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmechanic. A slatternly girl waited on him.
  1675	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1676	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How much is a plate of peas?” he asked.
  1677	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1678	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Three halfpence, sir,” said the girl.
  1679	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1680	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Bring me a plate of peas,” he said, “and a bottle of ginger beer.”
  1681	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1682	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his entry
  1683	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been followed by a pause of talk. His face was heated. To appear
  1684	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnatural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on the
  1685	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable. The mechanic and the two work-girls examined him point by point
  1686	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore resuming their conversation in a subdued voice. The girl brought
  1687	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim a plate of grocer’s hot peas, seasoned with pepper and vinegar, a
  1688	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfork and his ginger beer. He ate his food greedily and found it so good
  1689	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he made a note of the shop mentally. When he had eaten all the peas
  1690	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the sipped his ginger beer and sat for some time thinking of Corley’s
  1691	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadventure. In his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers walking along
  1692	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome dark road; he heard Corley’s voice in deep energetic gallantries
  1693	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand saw again the leer of the young woman’s mouth. This vision made
  1694	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit. He was tired
  1695	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof knocking about, of pulling the devil by the tail, of shifts and
  1696	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintrigues. He would be thirty-one in November. Would he never get a good
  1697	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjob? Would he never have a home of his own? He thought how pleasant it
  1698	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to sit down to.
  1699	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had walked the streets long enough with friends and with girls. He
  1700	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew what those friends were worth: he knew the girls too. Experience
  1701	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad embittered his heart against the world. But all hope had not left
  1702	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. He felt better after having eaten than he had felt before, less
  1703	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweary of his life, less vanquished in spirit. He might yet be able to
  1704	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsettle down in some snug corner and live happily if he could only come
  1705	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross some good simple-minded girl with a little of the ready.
  1706	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1707	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the
  1708	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop to begin his wandering again. He went into Capel Street and walked
  1709	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong towards the City Hall. Then he turned into Dame Street. At the
  1710	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorner of George’s Street he met two friends of his and stopped to
  1711	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconverse with them. He was glad that he could rest from all his walking.
  1712	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis friends asked him had he seen Corley and what was the latest. He
  1713	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treplied that he had spent the day with Corley. His friends talked
  1714	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery little. They looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and
  1715	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsometimes made a critical remark. One said that he had seen Mac an hour
  1716	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore in Westmoreland Street. At this Lenehan said that he had been
  1717	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Mac the night before in Egan’s. The young man who had seen Mac
  1718	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Westmoreland Street asked was it true that Mac had won a bit over
  1719	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta billiard match. Lenehan did not know: he said that Holohan had stood
  1720	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem drinks in Egan’s.
  1721	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1722	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up George’s Street.
  1723	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to the left at the City Markets and walked on into Grafton
  1724	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStreet. The crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way
  1725	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another
  1726	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood-night. He went as far as the clock of the College of Surgeons: it
  1727	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas on the stroke of ten. He set off briskly along the northern side
  1728	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Green hurrying for fear Corley should return too soon. When he
  1729	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treached the corner of Merrion Street he took his stand in the shadow of
  1730	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and
  1731	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlit it. He leaned against the lamp-post and kept his gaze fixed on the
  1732	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpart from which he expected to see Corley and the young woman return.
  1733	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1734	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis mind became active again. He wondered had Corley managed it
  1735	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuccessfully. He wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave
  1736	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit to the last. He suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend’s
  1737	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsituation as well as those of his own. But the memory of Corley’s slowly
  1738	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trevolving head calmed him somewhat: he was sure Corley would pull it off
  1739	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall right. All at once the idea struck him that perhaps Corley had seen
  1740	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther home by another way and given him the slip. His eyes searched the
  1741	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet: there was no sign of them. Yet it was surely half-an-hour since
  1742	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons. Would Corley do
  1743	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta thing like that? He lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it
  1744	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnervously. He strained his eyes as each tram stopped at the far corner
  1745	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the square. They must have gone home by another way. The paper of his
  1746	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a curse.
  1747	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1748	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSuddenly he saw them coming towards him. He started with delight and,
  1749	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkeeping close to his lamp-post, tried to read the result in their walk.
  1750	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick short steps,
  1751	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile Corley kept beside her with his long stride. They did not seem to
  1752	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe speaking. An intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a
  1753	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsharp instrument. He knew Corley would fail; he knew it was no go.
  1754	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1755	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at once, taking the
  1756	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother footpath. When they stopped he stopped too. They talked for a few
  1757	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of
  1758	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta house. Corley remained standing at the edge of the path, a little
  1759	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistance from the front steps. Some minutes passed. Then the hall-door
  1760	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas opened slowly and cautiously. A woman came running down the front
  1761	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsteps and coughed. Corley turned and went towards her. His broad figure
  1762	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running
  1763	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup the steps. The door closed on her and Corley began to walk swiftly
  1764	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards Stephen’s Green.
  1765	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1766	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan hurried on in the same direction. Some drops of light rain fell.
  1767	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the house which the
  1768	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung woman had entered to see that he was not observed, he ran eagerly
  1769	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross the road. Anxiety and his swift run made him pant. He called out:
  1770	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1771	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hallo, Corley!”
  1772	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1773	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley turned his head to see who had called him, and then continued
  1774	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on his
  1775	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshoulders with one hand.
  1776	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1777	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hallo, Corley!” he cried again.
  1778	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1779	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. He could
  1780	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee nothing there.
  1781	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1782	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well?” he said. “Did it come off?”
  1783	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1784	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without answering,
  1785	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley swerved to the left and went up the side street. His features
  1786	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing
  1787	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuneasily. He was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice.
  1788	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1789	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Can’t you tell us?” he said. “Did you try her?”
  1790	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1791	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him. Then
  1792	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and, smiling,
  1793	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. A small gold coin shone in
  1794	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe palm.
  1795	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1796	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1797	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1798	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE BOARDING HOUSE
  1799	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1800	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMRS MOONEY was a butcher’s daughter. She was a woman who was quite
  1801	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\table to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her
  1802	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather’s foreman and opened a butcher’s shop near Spring Gardens. But as
  1803	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoon as his father-in-law was dead Mr Mooney began to go to the devil.
  1804	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no use
  1805	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaking him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few days
  1806	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter. By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying
  1807	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbad meat he ruined his business. One night he went for his wife with the
  1808	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour’s house.
  1809	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1810	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a separation
  1811	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom him with care of the children. She would give him neither money
  1812	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a
  1813	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsheriff’s man. He was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face
  1814	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled above his little
  1815	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long he sat in the
  1816	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbailiff’s room, waiting to be put on a job. Mrs Mooney, who had taken
  1817	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a
  1818	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing woman. Her house
  1819	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool and the
  1820	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIsle of Man and, occasionally, _artistes_ from the music-halls. Its
  1821	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresident population was made up of clerks from the city. She governed
  1822	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be
  1823	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstern and when to let things pass. All the resident young men spoke of
  1824	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther as _The Madam_.
  1825	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1826	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Mooney’s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and
  1827	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common
  1828	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with
  1829	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone another. They discussed with one another the chances of favourites
  1830	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand outsiders. Jack Mooney, the Madam’s son, who was clerk to a
  1831	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommission agent in Fleet Street, had the reputation of being a hard
  1832	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase. He was fond of using soldiers’ obscenities: usually he came home
  1833	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the small hours. When he met his friends he had always a good one to
  1834	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thing--that is to
  1835	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay, a likely horse or a likely _artiste_. He was also handy with the
  1836	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmits and sang comic songs. On Sunday nights there would often be a
  1837	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treunion in Mrs Mooney’s front drawing-room. The music-hall _artistes_
  1838	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped
  1839	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam’s daughter, would also sing. She
  1840	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsang:
  1841	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1842	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1843	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_I’m a ... naughty girl. You needn’t sham: You know I am._
  1844	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1845	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small
  1846	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull mouth. Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through
  1847	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which
  1848	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade her look like a little perverse madonna. Mrs Mooney had first
  1849	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsent her daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor’s office but, as a
  1850	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisreputable sheriff’s man used to come every other day to the office,
  1851	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken her
  1852	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaughter home again and set her to do housework. As Polly was very
  1853	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlively the intention was to give her the run of the young men. Besides,
  1854	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away.
  1855	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs Mooney, who was a
  1856	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away:
  1857	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnone of them meant business. Things went on so for a long time and Mrs
  1858	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she
  1859	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young
  1860	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmen. She watched the pair and kept her own counsel.
  1861	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1862	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother’s persistent
  1863	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilence could not be misunderstood. There had been no open complicity
  1864	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween mother and daughter, no open understanding but, though people
  1865	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the house began to talk of the affair, still Mrs Mooney did not
  1866	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintervene. Polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the
  1867	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung man was evidently perturbed. At last, when she judged it to be the
  1868	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright moment, Mrs Mooney intervened. She dealt with moral problems as a
  1869	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had made up her mind.
  1870	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1871	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with
  1872	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the boarding house were open
  1873	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the
  1874	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\traised sashes. The belfry of George’s Church sent out constant peals and
  1875	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before
  1876	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained demeanour
  1877	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands. Breakfast
  1878	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was
  1879	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcovered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels
  1880	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof bacon-fat and bacon-rind. Mrs Mooney sat in the straw arm-chair and
  1881	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twatched the servant Mary remove the breakfast things. She made Mary
  1882	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to help to make Tuesday’s
  1883	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbread-pudding. When the table was cleared, the broken bread collected,
  1884	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sugar and butter safe under lock and key, she began to reconstruct
  1885	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe interview which she had had the night before with Polly. Things were
  1886	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas she had suspected: she had been frank in her questions and Polly had
  1887	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen frank in her answers. Both had been somewhat awkward, of course.
  1888	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe had been made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too
  1889	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and Polly had been
  1890	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her
  1891	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tawkward but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in
  1892	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother’s
  1893	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttolerance.
  1894	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1895	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the
  1896	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the
  1897	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbells of George’s Church had stopped ringing. It was seventeen minutes
  1898	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpast eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with Mr
  1899	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street. She was sure
  1900	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe would win. To begin with she had all the weight of social opinion
  1901	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton her side: she was an outraged mother. She had allowed him to live
  1902	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeneath her roof, assuming that he was a man of honour, and he had
  1903	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsimply abused her hospitality. He was thirty-four or thirty-five years
  1904	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof age, so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could
  1905	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of the
  1906	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld. He had simply taken advantage of Polly’s youth and inexperience:
  1907	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat was evident. The question was: What reparation would he make?
  1908	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1909	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere must be reparation made in such cases. It is all very well for
  1910	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe man: he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having had his
  1911	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt. Some mothers
  1912	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she had
  1913	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknown cases of it. But she would not do so. For her only one reparation
  1914	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould make up for the loss of her daughter’s honour: marriage.
  1915	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1916	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe counted all her cards again before sending Mary up to Mr Doran’s
  1917	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom to say that she wished to speak with him. She felt sure she would
  1918	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twin. He was a serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the
  1919	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers. If it had been Mr Sheridan or Mr Meade or Bantam Lyons her task
  1920	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould have been much harder. She did not think he would face publicity.
  1921	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair; details had
  1922	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen invented by some. Besides, he had been employed for thirteen years
  1923	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a great Catholic wine-merchant’s office and publicity would mean for
  1924	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim, perhaps, the loss of his job. Whereas if he agreed all might be
  1925	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell. She knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he
  1926	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad a bit of stuff put by.
  1927	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1928	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNearly the half-hour! She stood up and surveyed herself in the
  1929	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpier-glass. The decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied
  1930	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their
  1931	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaughters off their hands.
  1932	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1933	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning. He had made two
  1934	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been
  1935	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobliged to desist. Three days’ reddish beard fringed his jaws and every
  1936	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had
  1937	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto take them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief. The
  1938	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute
  1939	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the
  1940	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost
  1941	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation. The harm was done.
  1942	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat could he do now but marry her or run away? He could not brazen it
  1943	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout. The affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would
  1944	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe certain to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows
  1945	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teveryone else’s business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat
  1946	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he heard in his excited imagination old Mr Leonard calling out in his
  1947	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trasping voice: “Send Mr Doran here, please.”
  1948	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1949	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll his long years of service gone for nothing! All his industry and
  1950	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiligence thrown away! As a young man he had sown his wild oats, of
  1951	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of
  1952	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod to his companions in public-houses. But that was all passed and done
  1953	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith ... nearly. He still bought a copy of _Reynolds’s Newspaper_ every
  1954	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweek but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths of the
  1955	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyear lived a regular life. He had money enough to settle down on; it was
  1956	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot that. But the family would look down on her. First of all there
  1957	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas her disreputable father and then her mother’s boarding house was
  1958	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeginning to get a certain fame. He had a notion that he was being had.
  1959	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe could imagine his friends talking of the affair and laughing. She
  1960	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_was_ a little vulgar; sometimes she said “I seen” and “If I had’ve
  1961	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknown.” But what would grammar matter if he really loved her? He could
  1962	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot make up his mind whether to like her or despise her for what she
  1963	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad done. Of course he had done it too. His instinct urged him to remain
  1964	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfree, not to marry. Once you are married you are done for, it said.
  1965	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1966	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and
  1967	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered. She told him all,
  1968	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother
  1969	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould speak with him that morning. She cried and threw her arms round
  1970	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this neck, saying:
  1971	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1972	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?”
  1973	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1974	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe would put an end to herself, she said.
  1975	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1976	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all
  1977	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright, never fear. He felt against his shirt the agitation of her bosom.
  1978	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1979	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was not altogether his fault that it had happened. He remembered
  1980	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell, with the curious patient memory of the celibate, the first casual
  1981	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaresses her dress, her breath, her fingers had given him. Then late one
  1982	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnight as he was undressing for bed she had tapped at his door, timidly.
  1983	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe wanted to relight her candle at his for hers had been blown out by
  1984	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta gust. It was her bath night. She wore a loose open combing-jacket
  1985	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof printed flannel. Her white instep shone in the opening of her furry
  1986	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her perfumed skin. From her
  1987	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands and wrists too as she lit and steadied her candle a faint perfume
  1988	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarose.
  1989	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1990	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn nights when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his dinner.
  1991	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe scarcely knew what he was eating, feeling her beside him alone, at
  1992	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnight, in the sleeping house. And her thoughtfulness! If the night was
  1993	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyway cold or wet or windy there was sure to be a little tumbler of
  1994	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpunch ready for him. Perhaps they could be happy together....
  1995	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1996	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey used to go upstairs together on tiptoe, each with a candle, and on
  1997	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe third landing exchange reluctant good-nights. They used to kiss. He
  1998	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremembered well her eyes, the touch of her hand and his delirium....
  1999	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2000	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut delirium passes. He echoed her phrase, applying it to himself:
  2001	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_“What am I to do?”_ The instinct of the celibate warned him to hold
  2002	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback. But the sin was there; even his sense of honour told him that
  2003	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treparation must be made for such a sin.
  2004	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2005	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile he was sitting with her on the side of the bed Mary came to the
  2006	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor and said that the missus wanted to see him in the parlour. He stood
  2007	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup to put on his coat and waistcoat, more helpless than ever. When he
  2008	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas dressed he went over to her to comfort her. It would be all right,
  2009	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever fear. He left her crying on the bed and moaning softly: _“O my
  2010	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod!”_
  2011	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2012	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGoing down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that
  2013	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had to take them off and polish them. He longed to ascend through the
  2014	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troof and fly away to another country where he would never hear again
  2015	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his trouble, and yet a force pushed him downstairs step by step.
  2016	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe implacable faces of his employer and of the Madam stared upon his
  2017	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscomfiture. On the last flight of stairs he passed Jack Mooney who was
  2018	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of _Bass_. They saluted
  2019	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoldly; and the lover’s eyes rested for a second or two on a thick
  2020	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbulldog face and a pair of thick short arms. When he reached the foot of
  2021	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe staircase he glanced up and saw Jack regarding him from the door of
  2022	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe return-room.
  2023	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2024	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSuddenly he remembered the night when one of the music-hall _artistes_,
  2025	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta little blond Londoner, had made a rather free allusion to Polly.
  2026	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe reunion had been almost broken up on account of Jack’s violence.
  2027	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone tried to quiet him. The music-hall _artiste_, a little paler
  2028	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan usual, kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant: but
  2029	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJack kept shouting at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game
  2030	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton with _his_ sister he’d bloody well put his teeth down his throat, so
  2031	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the would.
  2032	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2033	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2034	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2035	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then she
  2036	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass. She dipped the end of
  2037	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe towel in the water-jug and refreshed her eyes with the cool water.
  2038	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear.
  2039	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot. She regarded
  2040	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her mind
  2041	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecret amiable memories. She rested the nape of her neck against the
  2042	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcool iron bed-rail and fell into a reverie. There was no longer any
  2043	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperturbation visible on her face.
  2044	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2045	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm, her memories
  2046	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future. Her hopes and
  2047	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvisions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows
  2048	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for
  2049	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything.
  2050	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2051	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt last she heard her mother calling. She started to her feet and ran to
  2052	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe banisters.
  2053	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2054	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Polly! Polly!”
  2055	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2056	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, mamma?”
  2057	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2058	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come down, dear. Mr Doran wants to speak to you.”
  2059	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2060	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen she remembered what she had been waiting for.
  2061	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2062	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2063	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2064	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA LITTLE CLOUD
  2065	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2066	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEIGHT years before he had seen his friend off at the North Wall and
  2067	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twished him godspeed. Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once
  2068	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few
  2069	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled
  2070	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby such success. Gallaher’s heart was in the right place and he had
  2071	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeserved to win. It was something to have a friend like that.
  2072	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2073	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his meeting
  2074	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Gallaher, of Gallaher’s invitation and of the great city London
  2075	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because, though
  2076	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was but slightly under the average stature, he gave one the idea
  2077	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof being a little man. His hands were white and small, his frame was
  2078	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfragile, his voice was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the
  2079	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used perfume
  2080	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscreetly on his handkerchief. The half-moons of his nails were perfect
  2081	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish white
  2082	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tteeth.
  2083	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2084	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought what changes those
  2085	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teight years had brought. The friend whom he had known under a shabby and
  2086	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnecessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the London Press. He
  2087	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window.
  2088	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks. It
  2089	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit
  2090	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told men who drowsed on the benches; it flickered upon all the moving
  2091	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfigures--on the children who ran screaming along the gravel paths and
  2092	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton everyone who passed through the gardens. He watched the scene and
  2093	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought of life; and (as always happened when he thought of life) he
  2094	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecame sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of him. He felt how
  2095	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuseless it was to struggle against fortune, this being the burden of
  2096	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him.
  2097	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2098	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home. He had
  2099	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbought them in his bachelor days and many an evening, as he sat in the
  2100	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle room off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down from the
  2101	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbookshelf and read out something to his wife. But shyness had always
  2102	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld him back; and so the books had remained on their shelves. At times
  2103	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the repeated lines to himself and this consoled him.
  2104	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2105	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of
  2106	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this fellow-clerks punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal
  2107	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and walked swiftly down
  2108	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHenrietta Street. The golden sunset was waning and the air had grown
  2109	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsharp. A horde of grimy children populated the street. They stood or
  2110	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or
  2111	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsquatted like mice upon the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no
  2112	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought. He picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin-like
  2113	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the
  2114	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told nobility of Dublin had roystered. No memory of the past touched him,
  2115	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor his mind was full of a present joy.
  2116	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2117	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had never been in Corless’s but he knew the value of the name. He
  2118	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink
  2119	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliqueurs; and he had heard that the waiters there spoke French and
  2120	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerman. Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn up before the
  2121	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor and richly dressed ladies, escorted by cavaliers, alight and
  2122	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenter quickly. They wore noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were
  2123	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpowdered and they caught up their dresses, when they touched earth,
  2124	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike alarmed Atalantas. He had always passed without turning his head
  2125	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto look. It was his habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and
  2126	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his
  2127	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes, however, he courted the
  2128	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcauses of his fear. He chose the darkest and narrowest streets and,
  2129	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he walked boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his
  2130	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfootsteps troubled him, the wandering silent figures troubled him; and
  2131	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf.
  2132	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2133	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to the right towards Capel Street. Ignatius Gallaher on the
  2134	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLondon Press! Who would have thought it possible eight years before?
  2135	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill, now that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could remember
  2136	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmany signs of future greatness in his friend. People used to say that
  2137	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher was wild. Of course, he did mix with a rakish set of
  2138	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellows at that time, drank freely and borrowed money on all sides.
  2139	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair, some money
  2140	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttransaction: at least, that was one version of his flight. But nobody
  2141	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdenied him talent. There was always a certain ... something in Ignatius
  2142	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself. Even when he was out
  2143	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat elbows and at his wits’ end for money he kept up a bold face. Little
  2144	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChandler remembered (and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride
  2145	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his cheek) one of Ignatius Gallaher’s sayings when he was in a tight
  2146	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorner:
  2147	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2148	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Half time now, boys,” he used to say light-heartedly. “Where’s my
  2149	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsidering cap?”
  2150	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2151	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn’t but
  2152	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadmire him for it.
  2153	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2154	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler quickened his pace. For the first time in his life he
  2155	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt himself superior to the people he passed. For the first time his
  2156	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street. There was no
  2157	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away. You could
  2158	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo nothing in Dublin. As he crossed Grattan Bridge he looked down the
  2159	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\triver towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses. They
  2160	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to him a band of tramps, huddled together along the riverbanks,
  2161	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir old coats covered with dust and soot, stupefied by the panorama
  2162	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise, shake
  2163	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthemselves and begone. He wondered whether he could write a poem to
  2164	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpress his idea. Perhaps Gallaher might be able to get it into some
  2165	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLondon paper for him. Could he write something original? He was not sure
  2166	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had
  2167	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttouched him took life within him like an infant hope. He stepped onward
  2168	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbravely.
  2169	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2170	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery step brought him nearer to London, farther from his own sober
  2171	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinartistic life. A light began to tremble on the horizon of his mind. He
  2172	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas not so old--thirty-two. His temperament might be said to be just
  2173	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the point of maturity. There were so many different moods and
  2174	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpressions that he wished to express in verse. He felt them within him.
  2175	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tried to weigh his soul to see if it was a poet’s soul. Melancholy
  2176	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas the dominant note of his temperament, he thought, but it was a
  2177	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmelancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and simple
  2178	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjoy. If he could give expression to it in a book of poems perhaps men
  2179	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould listen. He would never be popular: he saw that. He could not sway
  2180	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of kindred minds.
  2181	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe English critics, perhaps, would recognise him as one of the Celtic
  2182	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool by reason of the melancholy tone of his poems; besides that, he
  2183	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould put in allusions. He began to invent sentences and phrases from
  2184	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe notice which his book would get. _“Mr Chandler has the gift of easy
  2185	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand graceful verse.” ... “A wistful sadness pervades these poems.” ...
  2186	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Celtic note.”_ It was a pity his name was not more Irish-looking.
  2187	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPerhaps it would be better to insert his mother’s name before the
  2188	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsurname: Thomas Malone Chandler, or better still: T. Malone Chandler. He
  2189	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould speak to Gallaher about it.
  2190	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2191	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had
  2192	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto turn back. As he came near Corless’s his former agitation began to
  2193	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tovermaster him and he halted before the door in indecision. Finally he
  2194	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topened the door and entered.
  2195	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2196	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few
  2197	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoments. He looked about him, but his sight was confused by the shining
  2198	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof many red and green wine-glasses The bar seemed to him to be full
  2199	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof people and he felt that the people were observing him curiously. He
  2200	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced quickly to right and left (frowning slightly to make his errand
  2201	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappear serious), but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody
  2202	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad turned to look at him: and there, sure enough, was Ignatius Gallaher
  2203	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaning with his back against the counter and his feet planted far
  2204	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapart.
  2205	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2206	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hallo, Tommy, old hero, here you are! What is it to be? What will you
  2207	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave? I’m taking whisky: better stuff than we get across the water.
  2208	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSoda? Lithia? No mineral? I’m the same. Spoils the flavour.... Here,
  2209	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_garçon_, bring us two halves of malt whisky, like a good fellow....
  2210	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWell, and how have you been pulling along since I saw you last? Dear
  2211	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod, how old we’re getting! Do you see any signs of aging in me--eh,
  2212	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat? A little grey and thin on the top--what?”
  2213	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2214	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely cropped
  2215	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thead. His face was heavy, pale and clean-shaven. His eyes, which were of
  2216	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbluish slate-colour, relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly
  2217	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabove the vivid orange tie he wore. Between these rival features the
  2218	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlips appeared very long and shapeless and colourless. He bent his head
  2219	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand felt with two sympathetic fingers the thin hair at the crown. Little
  2220	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChandler shook his head as a denial. Ignatius Galaher put on his hat
  2221	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain.
  2222	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2223	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It pulls you down,” he said. “Press life. Always hurry and scurry,
  2224	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and then, always to have
  2225	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething new in your stuff. Damn proofs and printers, I say, for a few
  2226	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays. I’m deuced glad, I can tell you, to get back to the old country.
  2227	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoes a fellow good, a bit of a holiday. I feel a ton better since I
  2228	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanded again in dear dirty Dublin.... Here you are, Tommy. Water? Say
  2229	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen.”
  2230	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2231	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted.
  2232	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2233	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You don’t know what’s good for you, my boy,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “I
  2234	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrink mine neat.”
  2235	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2236	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I drink very little as a rule,” said Little Chandler modestly. “An odd
  2237	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalf-one or so when I meet any of the old crowd: that’s all.”
  2238	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2239	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, cheerfully, “here’s to us and to old
  2240	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttimes and old acquaintance.”
  2241	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2242	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey clinked glasses and drank the toast.
  2243	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2244	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I met some of the old gang today,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “O’Hara
  2245	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseems to be in a bad way. What’s he doing?”
  2246	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2247	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Nothing,” said Little Chandler. “He’s gone to the dogs.”
  2248	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2249	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But Hogan has a good sit, hasn’t he?”
  2250	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2251	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes; he’s in the Land Commission.”
  2252	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2253	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I met him one night in London and he seemed to be very flush.... Poor
  2254	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Hara! Boose, I suppose?”
  2255	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2256	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Other things, too,” said Little Chandler shortly.
  2257	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2258	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher laughed.
  2259	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2260	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tommy,” he said, “I see you haven’t changed an atom. You’re the very
  2261	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame serious person that used to lecture me on Sunday mornings when I
  2262	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad a sore head and a fur on my tongue. You’d want to knock about a bit
  2263	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the world. Have you never been anywhere even for a trip?”
  2264	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2265	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ve been to the Isle of Man,” said Little Chandler.
  2266	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2267	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher laughed.
  2268	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2269	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Isle of Man!” he said. “Go to London or Paris: Paris, for choice.
  2270	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’d do you good.”
  2271	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2272	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Have you seen Paris?”
  2273	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2274	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I should think I have! I’ve knocked about there a little.”
  2275	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2276	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And is it really so beautiful as they say?” asked Little Chandler.
  2277	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2278	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe sipped a little of his drink while Ignatius Gallaher finished his
  2279	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboldly.
  2280	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2281	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Beautiful?” said Ignatius Gallaher, pausing on the word and on the
  2282	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflavour of his drink. “It’s not so beautiful, you know. Of course, it is
  2283	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeautiful.... But it’s the life of Paris; that’s the thing. Ah, there’s
  2284	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno city like Paris for gaiety, movement, excitement....”
  2285	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2286	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler finished his whisky and, after some trouble, succeeded
  2287	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin catching the barman’s eye. He ordered the same again.
  2288	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2289	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ve been to the Moulin Rouge,” Ignatius Gallaher continued when the
  2290	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbarman had removed their glasses, “and I’ve been to all the Bohemian
  2291	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcafés. Hot stuff! Not for a pious chap like you, Tommy.”
  2292	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2293	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glasses:
  2294	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen he touched his friend’s glass lightly and reciprocated the former
  2295	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoast. He was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned. Gallaher’s
  2296	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccent and way of expressing himself did not please him. There was
  2297	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before. But
  2298	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps it was only the result of living in London amid the bustle and
  2299	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompetition of the Press. The old personal charm was still there under
  2300	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis new gaudy manner. And, after all, Gallaher had lived, he had seen
  2301	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe world. Little Chandler looked at his friend enviously.
  2302	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2303	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Everything in Paris is gay,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “They believe in
  2304	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenjoying life--and don’t you think they’re right? If you want to enjoy
  2305	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyourself properly you must go to Paris. And, mind you, they’ve a great
  2306	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeeling for the Irish there. When they heard I was from Ireland they
  2307	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere ready to eat me, man.”
  2308	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2309	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler took four or five sips from his glass.
  2310	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2311	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me,” he said, “is it true that Paris is so ... immoral as they
  2312	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay?”
  2313	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2314	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm.
  2315	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2316	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Every place is immoral,” he said. “Of course you do find spicy bits in
  2317	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tParis. Go to one of the students’ balls, for instance. That’s lively,
  2318	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif you like, when the _cocottes_ begin to let themselves loose. You know
  2319	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat they are, I suppose?”
  2320	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2321	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ve heard of them,” said Little Chandler.
  2322	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2323	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head.
  2324	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2325	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah,” he said, “you may say what you like. There’s no woman like the
  2326	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tParisienne--for style, for go.”
  2327	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2328	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Then it is an immoral city,” said Little Chandler, with timid
  2329	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinsistence--“I mean, compared with London or Dublin?”
  2330	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2331	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“London!” said Ignatius Gallaher. “It’s six of one and half-a-dozen of
  2332	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other. You ask Hogan, my boy. I showed him a bit about London when
  2333	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was over there. He’d open your eye.... I say, Tommy, don’t make punch
  2334	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that whisky: liquor up.”
  2335	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2336	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, really....”
  2337	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2338	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, come on, another one won’t do you any harm. What is it? The same
  2339	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain, I suppose?”
  2340	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2341	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well ... all right.”
  2342	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2343	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_François_, the same again.... Will you smoke, Tommy?”
  2344	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2345	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher produced his cigar-case. The two friends lit their
  2346	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served.
  2347	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2348	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll tell you my opinion,” said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some
  2349	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge, “it’s a rum
  2350	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld. Talk of immorality! I’ve heard of cases--what am I saying?--I’ve
  2351	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknown them: cases of ... immorality....”
  2352	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2353	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in a calm
  2354	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thistorian’s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures
  2355	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of many
  2356	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcapitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some things he
  2357	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had
  2358	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersonal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He revealed many
  2359	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some
  2360	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by
  2361	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttelling, with details, a story about an English duchess--a story which
  2362	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the knew to be true. Little Chandler was astonished.
  2363	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2364	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “here we are in old jog-along Dublin
  2365	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere nothing is known of such things.”
  2366	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2367	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How dull you must find it,” said Little Chandler, “after all the other
  2368	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplaces you’ve seen!”
  2369	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2370	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “it’s a relaxation to come over here,
  2371	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou know. And, after all, it’s the old country, as they say, isn’t it?
  2372	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYou can’t help having a certain feeling for it. That’s human nature....
  2373	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut tell me something about yourself. Hogan told me you had ... tasted
  2374	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe joys of connubial bliss. Two years ago, wasn’t it?”
  2375	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2376	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler blushed and smiled.
  2377	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2378	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” he said. “I was married last May twelve months.”
  2379	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2380	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I hope it’s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,” said
  2381	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher. “I didn’t know your address or I’d have done so at
  2382	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe time.”
  2383	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2384	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe extended his hand, which Little Chandler took.
  2385	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2386	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Tommy,” he said, “I wish you and yours every joy in life, old
  2387	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchap, and tons of money, and may you never die till I shoot you. And
  2388	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat’s the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend. You know that?”
  2389	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2390	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know that,” said Little Chandler.
  2391	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2392	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Any youngsters?” said Ignatius Gallaher.
  2393	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2394	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler blushed again.
  2395	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2396	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We have one child,” he said.
  2397	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2398	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Son or daughter?”
  2399	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2400	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A little boy.”
  2401	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2402	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back.
  2403	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2404	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Bravo,” he said, “I wouldn’t doubt you, Tommy.”
  2405	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2406	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower
  2407	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlip with three childishly white front teeth.
  2408	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2409	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I hope you’ll spend an evening with us,” he said, “before you go
  2410	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback. My wife will be delighted to meet you. We can have a little music
  2411	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand----”
  2412	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2413	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thanks awfully, old chap,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “I’m sorry we didn’t
  2414	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeet earlier. But I must leave tomorrow night.”
  2415	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2416	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tonight, perhaps...?”
  2417	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2418	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m awfully sorry, old man. You see I’m over here with another
  2419	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow, clever young chap he is too, and we arranged to go to a little
  2420	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcard-party. Only for that....”
  2421	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2422	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, in that case....”
  2423	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2424	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But who knows?” said Ignatius Gallaher considerately. “Next year I may
  2425	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake a little skip over here now that I’ve broken the ice. It’s only a
  2426	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasure deferred.”
  2427	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2428	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Very well,” said Little Chandler, “the next time you come we must have
  2429	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan evening together. That’s agreed now, isn’t it?”
  2430	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2431	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, that’s agreed,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “Next year if I come,
  2432	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_parole d’honneur_.”
  2433	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2434	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And to clinch the bargain,” said Little Chandler, “we’ll just have one
  2435	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore now.”
  2436	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2437	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it.
  2438	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2439	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is it to be the last?” he said. “Because you know, I have an a.p.”
  2440	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2441	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, yes, positively,” said Little Chandler.
  2442	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2443	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Very well, then,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “let us have another one as a
  2444	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_deoc an doruis_--that’s good vernacular for a small whisky, I believe.”
  2445	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2446	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler ordered the drinks. The blush which had risen to his
  2447	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface a few moments before was establishing itself. A trifle made
  2448	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited. Three small
  2449	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhiskies had gone to his head and Gallaher’s strong cigar had confused
  2450	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this mind, for he was a delicate and abstinent person. The adventure of
  2451	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeeting Gallaher after eight years, of finding himself with Gallaher
  2452	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Corless’s surrounded by lights and noise, of listening to Gallaher’s
  2453	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstories and of sharing for a brief space Gallaher’s vagrant and
  2454	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttriumphant life, upset the equipoise of his sensitive nature. He felt
  2455	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacutely the contrast between his own life and his friend’s and it seemed
  2456	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto him unjust. Gallaher was his inferior in birth and education. He was
  2457	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done, or
  2458	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould ever do, something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only
  2459	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgot the chance. What was it that stood in his way? His unfortunate
  2460	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttimidity! He wished to vindicate himself in some way, to assert his
  2461	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanhood. He saw behind Gallaher’s refusal of his invitation. Gallaher
  2462	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising
  2463	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIreland by his visit.
  2464	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2465	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe barman brought their drinks. Little Chandler pushed one glass
  2466	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards his friend and took up the other boldly.
  2467	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2468	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who knows?” he said, as they lifted their glasses. “When you come next
  2469	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyear I may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to Mr
  2470	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Mrs Ignatius Gallaher.”
  2471	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2472	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively
  2473	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover the rim of his glass. When he had drunk he smacked his lips
  2474	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdecisively, set down his glass and said:
  2475	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2476	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No blooming fear of that, my boy. I’m going to have my fling first and
  2477	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee a bit of life and the world before I put my head in the sack--if I
  2478	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tever do.”
  2479	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2480	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Some day you will,” said Little Chandler calmly.
  2481	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2482	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon
  2483	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this friend.
  2484	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2485	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You think so?” he said.
  2486	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2487	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’ll put your head in the sack,” repeated Little Chandler stoutly,
  2488	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“like everyone else if you can find the girl.”
  2489	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2490	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had
  2491	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetrayed himself; but, though the colour had heightened in his cheek, he
  2492	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not flinch from his friend’s gaze. Ignatius Gallaher watched him for
  2493	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta few moments and then said:
  2494	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2495	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If ever it occurs, you may bet your bottom dollar there’ll be no
  2496	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmooning and spooning about it. I mean to marry money. She’ll have a good
  2497	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfat account at the bank or she won’t do for me.”
  2498	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2499	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler shook his head.
  2500	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2501	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why, man alive,” said Ignatius Gallaher, vehemently, “do you know what
  2502	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit is? I’ve only to say the word and tomorrow I can have the woman
  2503	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the cash. You don’t believe it? Well, I know it. There are
  2504	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thundreds--what am I saying?--thousands of rich Germans and Jews, rotten
  2505	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith money, that’d only be too glad.... You wait a while my boy. See if
  2506	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI don’t play my cards properly. When I go about a thing I mean business,
  2507	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI tell you. You just wait.”
  2508	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2509	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tossed his glass to his mouth, finished his drink and laughed loudly.
  2510	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer tone:
  2511	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2512	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But I’m in no hurry. They can wait. I don’t fancy tying myself up to
  2513	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone woman, you know.”
  2514	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2515	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face.
  2516	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2517	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Must get a bit stale, I should think,” he said.
  2518	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2519	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2520	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2521	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in his
  2522	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarms. To save money they kept no servant but Annie’s young sister Monica
  2523	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening
  2524	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto help. But Monica had gone home long ago. It was a quarter to nine.
  2525	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler had come home late for tea and, moreover, he had
  2526	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Bewley’s. Of
  2527	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers. She said she
  2528	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the
  2529	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter
  2530	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar. She put the sleeping child
  2531	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeftly in his arms and said:
  2532	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2533	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here. Don’t waken him.”
  2534	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2535	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its
  2536	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlight fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled
  2537	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorn. It was Annie’s photograph. Little Chandler looked at it, pausing
  2538	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the thin tight lips. She wore the pale blue summer blouse which he
  2539	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad brought her home as a present one Saturday. It had cost him ten and
  2540	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\televenpence; but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him! How
  2541	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had suffered that day, waiting at the shop door until the shop was
  2542	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tempty, standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while
  2543	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe girl piled ladies’ blouses before him, paying at the desk and
  2544	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforgetting to take up the odd penny of his change, being called back by
  2545	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cashier, and finally, striving to hide his blushes as he left the
  2546	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied. When he
  2547	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought the blouse home Annie kissed him and said it was very pretty and
  2548	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstylish; but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table
  2549	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it.
  2550	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt first she wanted to take it back but when she tried it on she was
  2551	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelighted with it, especially with the make of the sleeves, and kissed
  2552	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim and said he was very good to think of her.
  2553	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2554	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHm!...
  2555	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2556	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered
  2557	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoldly. Certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty. But
  2558	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the found something mean in it. Why was it so unconscious and ladylike?
  2559	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe composure of the eyes irritated him. They repelled him and defied
  2560	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim: there was no passion in them, no rapture. He thought of what
  2561	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGallaher had said about rich Jewesses. Those dark Oriental eyes, he
  2562	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought, how full they are of passion, of voluptuous longing!... Why had
  2563	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the married the eyes in the photograph?
  2564	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2565	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the
  2566	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom. He found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had
  2567	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbought for his house on the hire system. Annie had chosen it herself and
  2568	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit reminded him of her. It too was prim and pretty. A dull resentment
  2569	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst his life awoke within him. Could he not escape from his little
  2570	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse? Was it too late for him to try to live bravely like Gallaher?
  2571	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCould he go to London? There was the furniture still to be paid for. If
  2572	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the could only write a book and get it published, that might open the way
  2573	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor him.
  2574	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2575	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA volume of Byron’s poems lay before him on the table. He opened it
  2576	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began
  2577	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto read the first poem in the book:
  2578	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2579	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2580	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom, Not e’en a Zephyr
  2581	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twanders through the grove, Whilst I return to view my Margaret’s tomb
  2582	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd scatter flowers on the dust I love._
  2583	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2584	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room.
  2585	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHow melancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that, express the
  2586	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmelancholy of his soul in verse? There were so many things he wanted
  2587	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto describe: his sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for
  2588	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texample. If he could get back again into that mood....
  2589	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2590	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and tried to
  2591	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thush it: but it would not be hushed. He began to rock it to and fro in
  2592	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this arms but its wailing cry grew keener. He rocked it faster while his
  2593	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes began to read the second stanza:
  2594	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2595	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2596	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Within this narrow cell reclines her clay, That clay where once...._
  2597	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2598	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was useless. He couldn’t read. He couldn’t do anything. The wailing
  2599	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was useless, useless!
  2600	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly
  2601	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbending to the child’s face he shouted:
  2602	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2603	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Stop!”
  2604	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2605	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to
  2606	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscream. He jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up and down the
  2607	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom with the child in his arms. It began to sob piteously, losing its
  2608	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath for four or five seconds, and then bursting out anew. The thin
  2609	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalls of the room echoed the sound. He tried to soothe it but it sobbed
  2610	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore convulsively. He looked at the contracted and quivering face of
  2611	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe child and began to be alarmed. He counted seven sobs without a
  2612	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreak between them and caught the child to his breast in fright. If it
  2613	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdied!...
  2614	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2615	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe door was burst open and a young woman ran in, panting.
  2616	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2617	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is it? What is it?” she cried.
  2618	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2619	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe child, hearing its mother’s voice, broke out into a paroxysm of
  2620	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsobbing.
  2621	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2622	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s nothing, Annie ... it’s nothing.... He began to cry....”
  2623	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2624	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him.
  2625	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2626	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What have you done to him?” she cried, glaring into his face.
  2627	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2628	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his
  2629	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart closed together as he met the hatred in them. He began to stammer:
  2630	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2631	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s nothing.... He ... he began to cry.... I couldn’t ... I didn’t do
  2632	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything.... What?”
  2633	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2634	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGiving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room, clasping
  2635	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe child tightly in her arms and murmuring:
  2636	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2637	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“My little man! My little mannie! Was ‘ou frightened, love?... There
  2638	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow, love! There now!... Lambabaun! Mamma’s little lamb of the world!...
  2639	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere now!”
  2640	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2641	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back
  2642	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child’s
  2643	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.
  2644	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2645	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2646	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2647	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCOUNTERPARTS
  2648	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2649	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the tube, a
  2650	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfurious voice called out in a piercing North of Ireland accent:
  2651	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2652	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Send Farrington here!”
  2653	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2654	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at
  2655	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta desk:
  2656	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2657	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Alleyne wants you upstairs.”
  2658	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2659	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man muttered “_Blast_ him!” under his breath and pushed back his
  2660	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchair to stand up. When he stood up he was tall and of great bulk.
  2661	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and
  2662	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were
  2663	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirty. He lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out of
  2664	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe office with a heavy step.
  2665	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2666	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing, where
  2667	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta door bore a brass plate with the inscription _Mr Alleyne_. Here he
  2668	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. The shrill voice
  2669	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcried:
  2670	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2671	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come in!”
  2672	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2673	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man entered Mr Alleyne’s room. Simultaneously Mr Alleyne, a little
  2674	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a clean-shaven face, shot his head
  2675	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup over a pile of documents. The head itself was so pink and hairless it
  2676	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed like a large egg reposing on the papers. Mr Alleyne did not lose
  2677	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta moment:
  2678	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2679	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Farrington? What is the meaning of this? Why have I always to complain
  2680	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof you? May I ask you why you haven’t made a copy of that contract
  2681	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween Bodley and Kirwan? I told you it must be ready by four o’clock.”
  2682	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2683	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But Mr Shelley said, sir----”
  2684	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2685	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_Mr Shelley said, sir...._ Kindly attend to what I say and not to
  2686	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat _Mr Shelley says, sir_. You have always some excuse or another for
  2687	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshirking work. Let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before
  2688	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis evening I’ll lay the matter before Mr Crosbie.... Do you hear me
  2689	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow?”
  2690	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2691	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, sir.”
  2692	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2693	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Do you hear me now?... Ay and another little matter! I might as well be
  2694	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking to the wall as talking to you. Understand once for all that you
  2695	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half. How many
  2696	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourses do you want, I’d like to know.... Do you mind me, now?”
  2697	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2698	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, sir.”
  2699	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2700	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers. The man stared
  2701	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of Crosbie &
  2702	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlleyne, gauging its fragility. A spasm of rage gripped his throat for
  2703	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta few moments and then passed, leaving after it a sharp sensation of
  2704	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthirst. The man recognised the sensation and felt that he must have a
  2705	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood night’s drinking. The middle of the month was passed and, if he
  2706	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould get the copy done in time, Mr Alleyne might give him an order on
  2707	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cashier. He stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of
  2708	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpapers. Suddenly Mr Alleyne began to upset all the papers, searching for
  2709	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething. Then, as if he had been unaware of the man’s presence till
  2710	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat moment, he shot up his head again, saying:
  2711	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2712	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Eh? Are you going to stand there all day? Upon my word, Farrington, you
  2713	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake things easy!”
  2714	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2715	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was waiting to see....”
  2716	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2717	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Very good, you needn’t wait to see. Go downstairs and do your work.”
  2718	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2719	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man walked heavily towards the door and, as he went out of the room,
  2720	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the heard Mr Alleyne cry after him that if the contract was not copied by
  2721	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening Mr Crosbie would hear of the matter.
  2722	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2723	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which
  2724	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremained to be copied. He took up his pen and dipped it in the ink but
  2725	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the continued to stare stupidly at the last words he had written: _In no
  2726	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase shall the said Bernard Bodley be...._ The evening was falling and
  2727	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a few minutes they would be lighting the gas: then he could write. He
  2728	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt that he must slake the thirst in his throat. He stood up from his
  2729	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdesk and, lifting the counter as before, passed out of the office. As he
  2730	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas passing out the chief clerk looked at him inquiringly.
  2731	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2732	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s all right, Mr Shelley,” said the man, pointing with his finger to
  2733	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindicate the objective of his journey.
  2734	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2735	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe chief clerk glanced at the hat-rack but, seeing the row complete,
  2736	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffered no remark. As soon as he was on the landing the man pulled
  2737	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta shepherd’s plaid cap out of his pocket, put it on his head and ran
  2738	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquickly down the rickety stairs. From the street door he walked on
  2739	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfurtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at
  2740	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce dived into a doorway. He was now safe in the dark snug of O’Neill’s
  2741	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop, and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his
  2742	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinflamed face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he called out:
  2743	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2744	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here, Pat, give us a g.p., like a good fellow.”
  2745	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2746	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe curate brought him a glass of plain porter. The man drank it at a
  2747	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgulp and asked for a caraway seed. He put his penny on the counter and,
  2748	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom, retreated out of the
  2749	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsnug as furtively as he had entered it.
  2750	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2751	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDarkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk of
  2752	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFebruary and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit. The man went up
  2753	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the houses until he reached the door of the office, wondering whether
  2754	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the could finish his copy in time. On the stairs a moist pungent odour of
  2755	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfumes saluted his nose: evidently Miss Delacour had come while he
  2756	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas out in O’Neill’s. He crammed his cap back again into his pocket and
  2757	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tre-entered the office, assuming an air of absent-mindedness.
  2758	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2759	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Alleyne has been calling for you,” said the chief clerk severely.
  2760	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where were you?”
  2761	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2762	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as
  2763	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif to intimate that their presence prevented him from answering. As the
  2764	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh.
  2765	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2766	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know that game,” he said. “Five times in one day is a little bit....
  2767	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWell, you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the
  2768	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDelacour case for Mr Alleyne.”
  2769	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2770	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs and the
  2771	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tporter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and, as he sat
  2772	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown at his desk to get what was required, he realised how hopeless was
  2773	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five.
  2774	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars,
  2775	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of
  2776	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglasses. He got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the
  2777	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffice. He hoped Mr Alleyne would not discover that the last two letters
  2778	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere missing.
  2779	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2780	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr Alleyne’s room. Miss
  2781	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDelacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish appearance. Mr Alleyne was
  2782	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid to be sweet on her or on her money. She came to the office often
  2783	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand stayed a long time when she came. She was sitting beside his desk
  2784	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and
  2785	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnodding the great black feather in her hat. Mr Alleyne had swivelled his
  2786	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left
  2787	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknee. The man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully
  2788	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut neither Mr Alleyne nor Miss Delacour took any notice of his bow.
  2789	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it
  2790	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards him as if to say: _“That’s all right: you can go.”_
  2791	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2792	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk.
  2793	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stared intently at the incomplete phrase: _In no case shall the said
  2794	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBernard Bodley be_ ... and thought how strange it was that the last
  2795	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthree words began with the same letter. The chief clerk began to hurry
  2796	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Parker, saying she would never have the letters typed in time for
  2797	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpost. The man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes
  2798	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand then set to work to finish his copy. But his head was not clear and
  2799	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the public-house. It
  2800	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a night for hot punches. He struggled on with his copy, but when
  2801	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write. Blast it!
  2802	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe couldn’t finish it in time. He longed to execrate aloud, to bring
  2803	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this fist down on something violently. He was so enraged that he wrote
  2804	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Bernard Bernard_ instead of _Bernard Bodley_ and had to begin again on
  2805	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta clean sheet.
  2806	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2807	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded. His
  2808	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbody ached to do something, to rush out and revel in violence. All
  2809	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe indignities of his life enraged him.... Could he ask the cashier
  2810	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprivately for an advance? No, the cashier was no good, no damn good:
  2811	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the wouldn’t give an advance.... He knew where he would meet the boys:
  2812	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeonard and O’Halloran and Nosey Flynn. The barometer of his emotional
  2813	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnature was set for a spell of riot.
  2814	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2815	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice
  2816	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore he answered. Mr Alleyne and Miss Delacour were standing outside
  2817	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe counter and all the clerks had turn round in anticipation of
  2818	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething. The man got up from his desk. Mr Alleyne began a tirade of
  2819	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabuse, saying that two letters were missing. The man answered that he
  2820	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew nothing about them, that he had made a faithful copy. The tirade
  2821	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontinued: it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly
  2822	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trestrain his fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before
  2823	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim:
  2824	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2825	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know nothing about any other two letters,” he said stupidly.
  2826	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2827	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_You--know--nothing_. Of course you know nothing,” said Mr Alleyne.
  2828	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me,” he added, glancing first for approval to the lady beside him,
  2829	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“do you take me for a fool? Do you think me an utter fool?”
  2830	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2831	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man glanced from the lady’s face to the little egg-shaped head and
  2832	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback again; and, almost before he was aware of it, his tongue had found
  2833	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta felicitous moment:
  2834	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2835	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t think, sir,” he said, “that that’s a fair question to put to
  2836	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme.”
  2837	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2838	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. Everyone was
  2839	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tastounded (the author of the witticism no less than his neighbours) and
  2840	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Delacour, who was a stout amiable person, began to smile broadly.
  2841	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild rose and his mouth twitched with
  2842	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta dwarf’s passion. He shook his fist in the man’s face till it seemed to
  2843	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvibrate like the knob of some electric machine:
  2844	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2845	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You impertinent ruffian! You impertinent ruffian! I’ll make short work
  2846	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof you! Wait till you see! You’ll apologise to me for your impertinence
  2847	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor you’ll quit the office instanter! You’ll quit this, I’m telling you,
  2848	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor you’ll apologise to me!”
  2849	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2850	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2851	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2852	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the cashier
  2853	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould come out alone. All the clerks passed out and finally the cashier
  2854	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame out with the chief clerk. It was no use trying to say a word to him
  2855	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he was with the chief clerk. The man felt that his position was bad
  2856	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenough. He had been obliged to offer an abject apology to Mr Alleyne for
  2857	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this impertinence but he knew what a hornet’s nest the office would
  2858	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe for him. He could remember the way in which Mr Alleyne had hounded
  2859	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle Peake out of the office in order to make room for his own nephew.
  2860	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe felt savage and thirsty and revengeful, annoyed with himself and with
  2861	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teveryone else. Mr Alleyne would never give him an hour’s rest; his life
  2862	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be a hell to him. He had made a proper fool of himself this time.
  2863	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCould he not keep his tongue in his cheek? But they had never pulled
  2864	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether from the first, he and Mr Alleyne, ever since the day Mr
  2865	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlleyne had overheard him mimicking his North of Ireland accent to amuse
  2866	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHiggins and Miss Parker: that had been the beginning of it. He might
  2867	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave tried Higgins for the money, but sure Higgins never had anything
  2868	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor himself. A man with two establishments to keep up, of course he
  2869	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouldn’t....
  2870	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2871	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the public-house.
  2872	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe fog had begun to chill him and he wondered could he touch Pat in
  2873	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Neill’s. He could not touch him for more than a bob--and a bob was
  2874	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno use. Yet he must get money somewhere or other: he had spent his
  2875	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast penny for the g.p. and soon it would be too late for getting money
  2876	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanywhere. Suddenly, as he was fingering his watch-chain, he thought of
  2877	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTerry Kelly’s pawn-office in Fleet Street. That was the dart! Why didn’t
  2878	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the think of it sooner?
  2879	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2880	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly, muttering to
  2881	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself that they could all go to hell because he was going to have a
  2882	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood night of it. The clerk in Terry Kelly’s said _A crown!_ but the
  2883	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsignor held out for six shillings; and in the end the six shillings
  2884	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas allowed him literally. He came out of the pawn-office joyfully,
  2885	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaking a little cylinder, of the coins between his thumb and fingers. In
  2886	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWestmoreland Street the footpaths were crowded with young men and women
  2887	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treturning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling
  2888	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout the names of the evening editions. The man passed through the crowd,
  2889	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring
  2890	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmasterfully at the office-girls. His head was full of the noises of
  2891	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram-gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the
  2892	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurling fumes of punch. As he walked on he preconsidered the terms in
  2893	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he would narrate the incident to the boys:
  2894	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2895	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So, I just looked at him--coolly, you know, and looked at her. Then I
  2896	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked back at him again--taking my time, you know. ‘I don’t think that
  2897	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat’s a fair question to put to me,’ says I.”
  2898	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2899	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNosey Flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of Davy Byrne’s and, when
  2900	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the heard the story, he stood Farrington a half-one, saying it was as
  2901	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmart a thing as ever he heard. Farrington stood a drink in his turn.
  2902	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a while O’Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was
  2903	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepeated to them. O’Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and
  2904	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttold the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was
  2905	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Callan’s of Fownes’s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner
  2906	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was
  2907	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot as clever as Farrington’s retort. At this Farrington told the boys
  2908	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto polish off that and have another.
  2909	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2910	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJust as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins!
  2911	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give
  2912	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of
  2913	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfive small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared
  2914	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing when he showed the way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in
  2915	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFarrington’s face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _“And here was
  2916	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy nabs, as cool as you please,”_ while Farrington looked at the company
  2917	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray
  2918	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip.
  2919	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2920	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen that round was over there was a pause. O’Halloran had money but
  2921	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tneither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left
  2922	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and
  2923	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back
  2924	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the city. Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when
  2925	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House.
  2926	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses.
  2927	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and
  2928	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tformed a little party at the corner of the counter. They began to
  2929	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named
  2930	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWeathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout
  2931	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_artiste_. Farrington stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would
  2932	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake a small Irish and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions
  2933	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too;
  2934	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became theatrical.
  2935	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round,
  2936	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWeathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He promised to
  2937	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls.
  2938	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that Farrington
  2939	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldn’t go because he was a married man; and Farrington’s heavy dirty
  2940	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being
  2941	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchaffed. Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his
  2942	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan’s in Poolbeg
  2943	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStreet.
  2944	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2945	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan’s. They went
  2946	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the parlour at the back and O’Halloran ordered small hot specials
  2947	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall round. They were all beginning to feel mellow. Farrington was just
  2948	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstanding another round when Weathers came back. Much to Farrington’s
  2949	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trelief he drank a glass of bitter this time. Funds were getting low but
  2950	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey had enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with big
  2951	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close
  2952	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the
  2953	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTivoli. Farrington’s eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of
  2954	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone of the young women. There was something striking in her appearance.
  2955	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAn immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and
  2956	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow
  2957	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgloves, reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump
  2958	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarm which she moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a
  2959	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark
  2960	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrown eyes. The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him. She
  2961	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced at him once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room,
  2962	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe brushed against his chair and said _“O, pardon!”_ in a London
  2963	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look
  2964	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback at him, but he was disappointed. He cursed his want of money and
  2965	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all the whiskies and
  2966	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tApollinaris which he had stood to Weathers. If there was one thing that
  2967	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the hated it was a sponge. He was so angry that he lost count of the
  2968	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconversation of his friends.
  2969	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2970	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about
  2971	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeats of strength. Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company
  2972	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to
  2973	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuphold the national honour. Farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly
  2974	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand showed his biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined
  2975	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. The
  2976	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping
  2977	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands. When Paddy Leonard said _“Go!”_ each was to try to bring down
  2978	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other’s hand on to the table. Farrington looked very serious and
  2979	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdetermined.
  2980	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2981	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his
  2982	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topponent’s hand slowly down on to the table. Farrington’s dark
  2983	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at
  2984	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaving been defeated by such a stripling.
  2985	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2986	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’re not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair,” he
  2987	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid.
  2988	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2989	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who’s not playing fair?” said the other.
  2990	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2991	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come on again. The two best out of three.”
  2992	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2993	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington’s forehead,
  2994	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the pallor of Weathers’ complexion changed to peony. Their hands
  2995	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand arms trembled under the stress. After a long struggle Weathers again
  2996	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought his opponent’s hand slowly on to the table. There was a murmur
  2997	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof applause from the spectators. The curate, who was standing beside
  2998	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe table, nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid
  2999	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamiliarity:
  3000	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3001	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah! that’s the knack!”
  3002	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3003	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What the hell do you know about it?” said Farrington fiercely, turning
  3004	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the man. “What do you put in your gab for?”
  3005	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3006	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sh, sh!” said O’Halloran, observing the violent expression of
  3007	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFarrington’s face. “Pony up, boys. We’ll have just one little smahan
  3008	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore and then we’ll be off.”
  3009	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3010	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3011	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3012	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA very sullen-faced man stood at the corner of O’Connell Bridge
  3013	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him home. He was full
  3014	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof smouldering anger and revengefulness. He felt humiliated and
  3015	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he had only twopence in
  3016	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this pocket. He cursed everything. He had done for himself in the office,
  3017	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpawned his watch, spent all his money; and he had not even got drunk.
  3018	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot
  3019	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treeking public-house. He had lost his reputation as a strong man, having
  3020	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled with fury and, when
  3021	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed against him and
  3022	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid _Pardon!_ his fury nearly choked him.
  3023	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3024	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered his great body
  3025	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong in the shadow of the wall of the barracks. He loathed returning
  3026	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his home. When he went in by the side-door he found the kitchen empty
  3027	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the kitchen fire nearly out. He bawled upstairs:
  3028	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3029	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ada! Ada!”
  3030	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3031	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis wife was a little sharp-faced woman who bullied her husband when
  3032	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was sober and was bullied by him when he was drunk. They had five
  3033	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildren. A little boy came running down the stairs.
  3034	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3035	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who is that?” said the man, peering through the darkness.
  3036	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3037	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Me, pa.”
  3038	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3039	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who are you? Charlie?”
  3040	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3041	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, pa. Tom.”
  3042	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3043	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where’s your mother?”
  3044	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3045	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s out at the chapel.”
  3046	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3047	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s right.... Did she think of leaving any dinner for me?”
  3048	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3049	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, pa. I----”
  3050	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3051	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Light the lamp. What do you mean by having the place in darkness? Are
  3052	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other children in bed?”
  3053	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3054	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little boy
  3055	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlit the lamp. He began to mimic his son’s flat accent, saying half to
  3056	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself: _“At the chapel. At the chapel, if you please!”_ When the lamp
  3057	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas lit he banged his fist on the table and shouted:
  3058	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3059	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What’s for my dinner?”
  3060	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3061	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m going ... to cook it, pa,” said the little boy.
  3062	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3063	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire.
  3064	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3065	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“On that fire! You let the fire out! By God, I’ll teach you to do that
  3066	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain!”
  3067	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3068	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took a step to the door and seized the walking-stick which was
  3069	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstanding behind it.
  3070	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3071	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll teach you to let the fire out!” he said, rolling up his sleeve in
  3072	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\torder to give his arm free play.
  3073	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3074	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe little boy cried _“O, pa!”_ and ran whimpering round the table, but
  3075	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe man followed him and caught him by the coat. The little boy looked
  3076	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout him wildly but, seeing no way of escape, fell upon his knees.
  3077	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3078	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, you’ll let the fire out the next time!” said the man striking at
  3079	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim vigorously with the stick. “Take that, you little whelp!”
  3080	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3081	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh. He clasped
  3082	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hands together in the air and his voice shook with fright.
  3083	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3084	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, pa!” he cried. “Don’t beat me, pa! And I’ll ... I’ll say a _Hail
  3085	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary_ for you.... I’ll say a _Hail Mary_ for you, pa, if you don’t beat
  3086	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme.... I’ll say a _Hail Mary_....”
  3087	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3088	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3089	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3090	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCLAY
  3091	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3092	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE matron had given her leave to go out as soon as the women’s tea was
  3093	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover and Maria looked forward to her evening out. The kitchen was
  3094	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspick and span: the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper
  3095	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboilers. The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were
  3096	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfour very big barmbracks. These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if you went
  3097	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcloser you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices
  3098	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand were ready to be handed round at tea. Maria had cut them herself.
  3099	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3100	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very long
  3101	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnose and a very long chin. She talked a little through her nose, always
  3102	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoothingly: _“Yes, my dear,”_ and _“No, my dear.”_ She was always sent
  3103	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in
  3104	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaking peace. One day the matron had said to her:
  3105	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3106	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Maria, you are a veritable peace-maker!”
  3107	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3108	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the compliment.
  3109	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Ginger Mooney was always saying what she wouldn’t do to the dummy
  3110	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho had charge of the irons if it wasn’t for Maria. Everyone was so fond
  3111	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Maria.
  3112	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3113	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe women would have their tea at six o’clock and she would be able to
  3114	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget away before seven. From Ballsbridge to the Pillar, twenty minutes;
  3115	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the Pillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to buy
  3116	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe things. She would be there before eight. She took out her purse with
  3117	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe silver clasps and read again the words _A Present from Belfast_. She
  3118	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas very fond of that purse because Joe had brought it to her five years
  3119	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore when he and Alphy had gone to Belfast on a Whit-Monday trip. In
  3120	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe purse were two half-crowns and some coppers. She would have five
  3121	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshillings clear after paying tram fare. What a nice evening they would
  3122	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave, all the children singing! Only she hoped that Joe wouldn’t come in
  3123	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrunk. He was so different when he took any drink.
  3124	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3125	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOften he had wanted her to go and live with them; but she would have
  3126	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt herself in the way (though Joe’s wife was ever so nice with her)
  3127	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand she had become accustomed to the life of the laundry. Joe was a good
  3128	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow. She had nursed him and Alphy too; and Joe used often say:
  3129	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3130	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mamma is mamma but Maria is my proper mother.”
  3131	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3132	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter the break-up at home the boys had got her that position in the
  3133	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Dublin by Lamplight_ laundry, and she liked it. She used to have such
  3134	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bad opinion of Protestants but now she thought they were very nice
  3135	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople, a little quiet and serious, but still very nice people to live
  3136	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith. Then she had her plants in the conservatory and she liked looking
  3137	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter them. She had lovely ferns and wax-plants and, whenever anyone
  3138	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame to visit her, she always gave the visitor one or two slips from
  3139	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther conservatory. There was one thing she didn’t like and that was the
  3140	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttracts on the walks; but the matron was such a nice person to deal with,
  3141	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso genteel.
  3142	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3143	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the cook told her everything was ready she went into the women’s
  3144	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom and began to pull the big bell. In a few minutes the women began
  3145	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their
  3146	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpetticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red
  3147	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsteaming arms. They settled down before their huge mugs which the cook
  3148	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the dummy filled up with hot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar
  3149	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin huge tin cans. Maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack
  3150	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand saw that every woman got her four slices. There was a great deal of
  3151	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing and joking during the meal. Lizzie Fleming said Maria was sure
  3152	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto get the ring and, though Fleming had said that for so many Hallow
  3153	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEves, Maria had to laugh and say she didn’t want any ring or man either;
  3154	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with disappointed
  3155	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin. Then
  3156	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGinger Mooney lifted up her mug of tea and proposed Maria’s health while
  3157	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the other women clattered with their mugs on the table, and said she
  3158	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sorry she hadn’t a sup of porter to drink it in. And Maria laughed
  3159	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin and till
  3160	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther minute body nearly shook itself asunder because she knew that Mooney
  3161	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeant well though, of course, she had the notions of a common woman.
  3162	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3163	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut wasn’t Maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook
  3164	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the dummy had begun to clear away the tea-things! She went into
  3165	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther little bedroom and, remembering that the next morning was a mass
  3166	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning, changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six. Then she took
  3167	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff her working skirt and her house-boots and laid her best skirt out on
  3168	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bed and her tiny dress-boots beside the foot of the bed. She changed
  3169	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther blouse too and, as she stood before the mirror, she thought of how
  3170	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe used to dress for mass on Sunday morning when she was a young girl;
  3171	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand she looked with quaint affection at the diminutive body which she
  3172	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad so often adorned. In spite of its years she found it a nice tidy
  3173	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle body.
  3174	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3175	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was glad
  3176	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her old brown waterproof. The tram was full and she had to sit on the
  3177	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle stool at the end of the car, facing all the people, with her toes
  3178	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbarely touching the floor. She arranged in her mind all she was going to
  3179	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo and thought how much better it was to be independent and to have your
  3180	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\town money in your pocket. She hoped they would have a nice evening. She
  3181	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sure they would but she could not help thinking what a pity it was
  3182	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlphy and Joe were not speaking. They were always falling out now but
  3183	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen they were boys together they used to be the best of friends: but
  3184	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch was life.
  3185	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3186	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe got out of her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way quickly among
  3187	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe crowds. She went into Downes’s cake-shop but the shop was so full of
  3188	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople that it was a long time before she could get herself attended
  3189	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto. She bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes, and at last came out of the
  3190	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop laden with a big bag. Then she thought what else would she buy: she
  3191	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twanted to buy something really nice. They would be sure to have plenty
  3192	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof apples and nuts. It was hard to know what to buy and all she could
  3193	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthink of was cake. She decided to buy some plumcake but Downes’s
  3194	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she went over to
  3195	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta shop in Henry Street. Here she was a long time in suiting herself and
  3196	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stylish young lady behind the counter, who was evidently a little
  3197	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tannoyed by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she wanted to buy. That
  3198	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took it
  3199	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake, parcelled
  3200	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit up and said:
  3201	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3202	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Two-and-four, please.”
  3203	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3204	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe thought she would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram because none
  3205	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the young men seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made room
  3206	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her. He was a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat; he had
  3207	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta square red face and a greyish moustache. Maria thought he was a
  3208	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcolonel-looking gentleman and she reflected how much more polite he was
  3209	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan the young men who simply stared straight before them. The gentleman
  3210	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to chat with her about Hallow Eve and the rainy weather. He
  3211	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said
  3212	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves while they
  3213	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere young. Maria agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and
  3214	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thems. He was very nice with her, and when she was getting out at the
  3215	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCanal Bridge she thanked him and bowed, and he bowed to her and raised
  3216	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hat and smiled agreeably, and while she was going up along the
  3217	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterrace, bending her tiny head under the rain, she thought how easy it
  3218	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken.
  3219	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3220	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEverybody said: _“O, here’s Maria!”_ when she came to Joe’s house. Joe
  3221	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas there, having come home from business, and all the children had
  3222	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir Sunday dresses on. There were two big girls in from next door
  3223	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand games were going on. Maria gave the bag of cakes to the eldest boy,
  3224	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlphy, to divide and Mrs Donnelly said it was too good of her to bring
  3225	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch a big bag of cakes and made all the children say:
  3226	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3227	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thanks, Maria.”
  3228	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3229	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Maria said she had brought something special for papa and mamma,
  3230	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething they would be sure to like, and she began to look for her
  3231	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplumcake. She tried in Downes’s bag and then in the pockets of her
  3232	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaterproof and then on the hallstand but nowhere could she find it.
  3233	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen she asked all the children had any of them eaten it--by mistake, of
  3234	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse--but the children all said no and looked as if they did not like
  3235	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing. Everybody had a
  3236	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsolution for the mystery and Mrs Donnelly said it was plain that Maria
  3237	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad left it behind her in the tram. Maria, remembering how confused the
  3238	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentleman with the greyish moustache had made her, coloured with shame
  3239	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand vexation and disappointment. At the thought of the failure of her
  3240	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for
  3241	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing she nearly cried outright.
  3242	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3243	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Joe said it didn’t matter and made her sit down by the fire. He
  3244	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas very nice with her. He told her all that went on in his office,
  3245	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager. Maria
  3246	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not understand why Joe laughed so much over the answer he had made
  3247	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person
  3248	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto deal with. Joe said he wasn’t so bad when you knew how to take him,
  3249	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he was a decent sort so long as you didn’t rub him the wrong way.
  3250	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang.
  3251	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen the two next-door girls handed round the nuts. Nobody could find
  3252	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how
  3253	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid they expect Maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker. But Maria said
  3254	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe didn’t like nuts and that they weren’t to bother about her. Then Joe
  3255	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked would she take a bottle of stout and Mrs Donnelly said there was
  3256	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tport wine too in the house if she would prefer that. Maria said she
  3257	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould rather they didn’t ask her to take anything: but Joe insisted.
  3258	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3259	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old
  3260	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttimes and Maria thought she would put in a good word for Alphy. But Joe
  3261	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcried that God might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to
  3262	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this brother again and Maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the
  3263	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatter. Mrs Donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to
  3264	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeak that way of his own flesh and blood but Joe said that Alphy was no
  3265	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it. But
  3266	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJoe said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was
  3267	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand asked his wife to open some more stout. The two next-door girls
  3268	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again.
  3269	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his wife in
  3270	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table
  3271	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand then led the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the
  3272	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the
  3273	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnext-door girls got the ring Mrs Donnelly shook her finger at the
  3274	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblushing girl as much as to say: _O, I know all about it!_ They insisted
  3275	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen on blindfolding Maria and leading her up to the table to see
  3276	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat she would get; and, while they were putting on the bandage, Maria
  3277	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of
  3278	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther chin.
  3279	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3280	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her
  3281	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thand out in the air as she was told to do. She moved her hand about here
  3282	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand there in the air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt a
  3283	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke
  3284	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor took off her bandage. There was a pause for a few seconds; and then
  3285	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta great deal of scuffling and whispering. Somebody said something about
  3286	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe garden, and at last Mrs Donnelly said something very cross to one
  3287	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the next-door girls and told her to throw it out at once: that was no
  3288	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplay. Maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she had to do
  3289	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit over again: and this time she got the prayer-book.
  3290	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3291	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter that Mrs Donnelly played Miss McCloud’s Reel for the children
  3292	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Joe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they were all quite merry
  3293	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain and Mrs Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year
  3294	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas out because she had got the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe
  3295	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso nice to her as he was that night, so full of pleasant talk and
  3296	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treminiscences. She said they were all very good to her.
  3297	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3298	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would
  3299	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe not sing some little song before she went, one of the old songs.
  3300	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Donnelly said _“Do, please, Maria!”_ and so Maria had to get up
  3301	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand stand beside the piano. Mrs Donnelly bade the children be quiet
  3302	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand listen to Maria’s song. Then she played the prelude and said _“Now,
  3303	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaria!”_ and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering
  3304	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice. She sang _I Dreamt that I Dwelt_, and when she came to the second
  3305	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tverse she sang again:
  3306	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3307	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3308	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls With vassals and serfs at my side
  3309	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd of all who assembled within those walls That I was the hope and the
  3310	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpride. I had riches too great to count, could boast Of a high ancestral
  3311	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname, But I also dreamt, which pleased me most, That you loved me still
  3312	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe same._
  3313	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3314	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her
  3315	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsong Joe was very much moved. He said that there was no time like the
  3316	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong ago and no music for him like poor old Balfe, whatever other people
  3317	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmight say; and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not
  3318	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfind what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to
  3319	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttell him where the corkscrew was.
  3320	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3321	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3322	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3323	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA PAINFUL CASE
  3324	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3325	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMR JAMES DUFFY lived in Chapelizod because he wished to live as far as
  3326	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found
  3327	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and pretentious. He lived
  3328	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the
  3329	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which Dublin is
  3330	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuilt. The lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from pictures.
  3331	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had himself bought every article of furniture in the room: a black
  3332	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tiron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a clothes-rack,
  3333	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a
  3334	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdouble desk. A bookcase had been made in an alcove by means of shelves
  3335	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof white wood. The bed was clothed with white bedclothes and a black
  3336	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand scarlet rug covered the foot. A little hand-mirror hung above the
  3337	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twashstand and during the day a white-shaded lamp stood as the sole
  3338	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tornament of the mantelpiece. The books on the white wooden shelves were
  3339	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarranged from below upwards according to bulk. A complete Wordsworth
  3340	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the _Maynooth
  3341	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCatechism_, sewn into the cloth cover of a notebook, stood at one end
  3342	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the top shelf. Writing materials were always on the desk. In the desk
  3343	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlay a manuscript translation of Hauptmann’s _Michael Kramer_, the stage
  3344	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirections of which were written in purple ink, and a little sheaf of
  3345	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpapers held together by a brass pin. In these sheets a sentence was
  3346	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinscribed from time to time and, in an ironical moment, the headline of
  3347	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan advertisement for _Bile Beans_ had been pasted on to the first sheet.
  3348	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn lifting the lid of the desk a faint fragrance escaped--the fragrance
  3349	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof new cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or of an overripe apple
  3350	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich might have been left there and forgotten.
  3351	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3352	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental disorder.
  3353	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA mediæval doctor would have called him saturnine. His face, which
  3354	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarried the entire tale of his years, was of the brown tint of Dublin
  3355	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreets. On his long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a
  3356	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth. His cheekbones
  3357	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talso gave his face a harsh character; but there was no harshness in the
  3358	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes which, looking at the world from under their tawny eyebrows, gave
  3359	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe impression of a man ever alert to greet a redeeming instinct in
  3360	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers but often disappointed. He lived at a little distance from his
  3361	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbody, regarding his own acts with doubtful side-glances. He had an odd
  3362	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tautobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time
  3363	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third
  3364	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperson and a predicate in the past tense. He never gave alms to beggars
  3365	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand walked firmly, carrying a stout hazel.
  3366	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3367	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had been for many years cashier of a private bank in Baggot Street.
  3368	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery morning he came in from Chapelizod by tram. At midday he went
  3369	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Dan Burke’s and took his lunch--a bottle of lager beer and a small
  3370	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrayful of arrowroot biscuits. At four o’clock he was set free. He dined
  3371	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin an eating-house in George’s Street where he felt himself safe from
  3372	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe society of Dublin’s gilded youth and where there was a certain plain
  3373	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonesty in the bill of fare. His evenings were spent either before his
  3374	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlandlady’s piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city. His liking
  3375	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor Mozart’s music brought him sometimes to an opera or a concert: these
  3376	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere the only dissipations of his life.
  3377	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3378	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had neither companions nor friends, church nor creed. He lived his
  3379	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspiritual life without any communion with others, visiting his relatives
  3380	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat Christmas and escorting them to the cemetery when they died. He
  3381	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperformed these two social duties for old dignity’s sake but conceded
  3382	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing further to the conventions which regulate the civic life. He
  3383	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallowed himself to think that in certain circumstances he would rob
  3384	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this bank but, as these circumstances never arose, his life rolled out
  3385	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevenly--an adventureless tale.
  3386	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3387	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne evening he found himself sitting beside two ladies in the Rotunda.
  3388	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe house, thinly peopled and silent, gave distressing prophecy of
  3389	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailure. The lady who sat next him looked round at the deserted house
  3390	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce or twice and then said:
  3391	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3392	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What a pity there is such a poor house tonight! It’s so hard on people
  3393	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto have to sing to empty benches.”
  3394	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3395	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took the remark as an invitation to talk. He was surprised that
  3396	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe seemed so little awkward. While they talked he tried to fix her
  3397	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpermanently in his memory. When he learned that the young girl beside
  3398	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther was her daughter he judged her to be a year or so younger than
  3399	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself. Her face, which must have been handsome, had remained
  3400	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintelligent. It was an oval face with strongly marked features. The eyes
  3401	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere very dark blue and steady. Their gaze began with a defiant note
  3402	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut was confused by what seemed a deliberate swoon of the pupil into the
  3403	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tiris, revealing for an instant a temperament of great sensibility. The
  3404	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpupil reasserted itself quickly, this half-disclosed nature fell again
  3405	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder the reign of prudence, and her astrakhan jacket, moulding a bosom
  3406	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a certain fullness, struck the note of defiance more definitely.
  3407	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3408	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort
  3409	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTerrace and seized the moments when her daughter’s attention was
  3410	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiverted to become intimate. She alluded once or twice to her husband
  3411	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning. Her name
  3412	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas Mrs Sinico. Her husband’s great-great-grandfather had come from
  3413	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeghorn. Her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between
  3414	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin and Holland; and they had one child.
  3415	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3416	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMeeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an
  3417	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappointment. She came. This was the first of many meetings; they met
  3418	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks
  3419	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether. Mr Duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and,
  3420	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to
  3421	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\task him to her house. Captain Sinico encouraged his visits, thinking
  3422	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat his daughter’s hand was in question. He had dismissed his wife so
  3423	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that
  3424	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyone else would take an interest in her. As the husband was often
  3425	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taway and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr Duffy had many
  3426	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topportunities of enjoying the lady’s society. Neither he nor she had had
  3427	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity.
  3428	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle by little he entangled his thoughts with hers. He lent her books,
  3429	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprovided her with ideas, shared his intellectual life with her. She
  3430	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistened to all.
  3431	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3432	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own
  3433	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife. With almost maternal solicitude she urged him to let his nature
  3434	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topen to the full: she became his confessor. He told her that for some
  3435	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime he had assisted at the meetings of an Irish Socialist Party where
  3436	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in
  3437	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta garret lit by an inefficient oil-lamp. When the party had divided into
  3438	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthree sections, each under its own leader and in its own garret, he had
  3439	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscontinued his attendances. The workmen’s discussions, he said,
  3440	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere too timorous; the interest they took in the question of wages was
  3441	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinordinate. He felt that they were hard-featured realists and that they
  3442	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresented an exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not within
  3443	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir reach. No social revolution, he told her, would be likely to
  3444	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrike Dublin for some centuries.
  3445	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3446	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe asked him why did he not write out his thoughts. For what, he asked
  3447	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther, with careful scorn. To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of
  3448	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthinking consecutively for sixty seconds? To submit himself to the
  3449	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcriticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted its morality to
  3450	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpolicemen and its fine arts to impresarios?
  3451	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3452	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went often to her little cottage outside Dublin; often they spent
  3453	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir evenings alone. Little by little, as their thoughts entangled,
  3454	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey spoke of subjects less remote. Her companionship was like a warm
  3455	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoil about an exotic. Many times she allowed the dark to fall upon
  3456	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem, refraining from lighting the lamp. The dark discreet room, their
  3457	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tisolation, the music that still vibrated in their ears united them.
  3458	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis union exalted him, wore away the rough edges of his character,
  3459	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\temotionalised his mental life. Sometimes he caught himself listening to
  3460	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sound of his own voice. He thought that in her eyes he would ascend
  3461	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his
  3462	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompanion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal
  3463	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul’s incurable
  3464	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloneliness. We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. The end
  3465	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every
  3466	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsign of unusual excitement, Mrs Sinico caught up his hand passionately
  3467	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand pressed it to her cheek.
  3468	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3469	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Duffy was very much surprised. Her interpretation of his words
  3470	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisillusioned him. He did not visit her for a week, then he wrote to her
  3471	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasking her to meet him. As he did not wish their last interview to be
  3472	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttroubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a
  3473	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle cakeshop near the Parkgate. It was cold autumn weather but in
  3474	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the Park for
  3475	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnearly three hours. They agreed to break off their intercourse: every
  3476	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbond, he said, is a bond to sorrow. When they came out of the Park they
  3477	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked in silence towards the tram; but here she began to tremble
  3478	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso violently that, fearing another collapse on her part, he bade her
  3479	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood-bye quickly and left her. A few days later he received a parcel
  3480	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontaining his books and music.
  3481	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3482	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFour years passed. Mr Duffy returned to his even way of life. His room
  3483	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill bore witness of the orderliness of his mind. Some new pieces of
  3484	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusic encumbered the music-stand in the lower room and on his shelves
  3485	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood two volumes by Nietzsche: _Thus Spake Zarathustra_ and _The Gay
  3486	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tScience_. He wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his desk.
  3487	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne of his sentences, written two months after his last interview with
  3488	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Sinico, read: Love between man and man is impossible because there
  3489	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmust not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman is
  3490	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpossible because there must be sexual intercourse. He kept away from
  3491	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcerts lest he should meet her. His father died; the junior partner of
  3492	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bank retired. And still every morning he went into the city by
  3493	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined
  3494	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoderately in George’s Street and read the evening paper for dessert.
  3495	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3496	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne evening as he was about to put a morsel of corned beef and cabbage
  3497	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto his mouth his hand stopped. His eyes fixed themselves on a
  3498	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparagraph in the evening paper which he had propped against the
  3499	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twater-carafe. He replaced the morsel of food on his plate and read the
  3500	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparagraph attentively. Then he drank a glass of water, pushed his plate
  3501	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto one side, doubled the paper down before him between his elbows and
  3502	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tread the paragraph over and over again. The cabbage began to deposit a
  3503	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcold white grease on his plate. The girl came over to him to ask was
  3504	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this dinner not properly cooked. He said it was very good and ate a few
  3505	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouthfuls of it with difficulty. Then he paid his bill and went out.
  3506	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3507	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked along quickly through the November twilight, his stout hazel
  3508	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstick striking the ground regularly, the fringe of the buff _Mail_
  3509	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeeping out of a side-pocket of his tight reefer overcoat. On the lonely
  3510	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troad which leads from the Parkgate to Chapelizod he slackened his pace.
  3511	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath, issuing
  3512	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tirregularly, almost with a sighing sound, condensed in the wintry air.
  3513	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom and, taking
  3514	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe paper from his pocket, read the paragraph again by the failing light
  3515	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the window. He read it not aloud, but moving his lips as a priest
  3516	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoes when he reads the prayers _Secreto_. This was the paragraph:
  3517	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3518	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3519	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDEATH OF A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE A PAINFUL CASE
  3520	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3521	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tToday at the City of Dublin Hospital the Deputy Coroner (in the absence
  3522	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Mr Leverett) held an inquest on the body of Mrs Emily Sinico, aged
  3523	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday
  3524	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening. The evidence showed that the deceased lady, while attempting to
  3525	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcross the line, was knocked down by the engine of the ten o’clock slow
  3526	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrain from Kingstown, thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right
  3527	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tside which led to her death.
  3528	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3529	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJames Lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he had been in the
  3530	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\temployment of the railway company for fifteen years. On hearing
  3531	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe guard’s whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two
  3532	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries. The train was
  3533	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoing slowly.
  3534	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3535	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tP. Dunne, railway porter, stated that as the train was about to start he
  3536	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobserved a woman attempting to cross the lines. He ran towards her and
  3537	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshouted, but, before he could reach her, she was caught by the buffer of
  3538	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe engine and fell to the ground.
  3539	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3540	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_A juror_. “You saw the lady fall?”
  3541	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3542	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Witness_. “Yes.”
  3543	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3544	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolice Sergeant Croly deposed that when he arrived he found the deceased
  3545	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlying on the platform apparently dead. He had the body taken to the
  3546	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance.
  3547	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3548	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConstable 57E corroborated.
  3549	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3550	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDr Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin Hospital,
  3551	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained
  3552	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsevere contusions of the right shoulder. The right side of the head
  3553	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been injured in the fall. The injuries were not sufficient to
  3554	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave caused death in a normal person. Death, in his opinion, had been
  3555	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprobably due to shock and sudden failure of the heart’s action.
  3556	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3557	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr H. B. Patterson Finlay, on behalf of the railway company, expressed
  3558	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this deep regret at the accident. The company had always taken every
  3559	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprecaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges,
  3560	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboth by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent spring
  3561	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgates at level crossings. The deceased had been in the habit of crossing
  3562	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lines late at night from platform to platform and, in view of
  3563	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcertain other circumstances of the case, he did not think the railway
  3564	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tofficials were to blame.
  3565	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3566	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCaptain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the deceased,
  3567	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talso gave evidence. He stated that the deceased was his wife. He was
  3568	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot in Dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that
  3569	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning from Rotterdam. They had been married for twenty-two years and
  3570	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be
  3571	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trather intemperate in her habits.
  3572	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3573	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit
  3574	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof going out at night to buy spirits. She, witness, had often tried to
  3575	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. She was not
  3576	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat home until an hour after the accident. The jury returned a verdict
  3577	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all
  3578	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblame.
  3579	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3580	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great
  3581	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter. He urged on the railway
  3582	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompany to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar
  3583	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccidents in the future. No blame attached to anyone.
  3584	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3585	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3586	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3587	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on
  3588	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cheerless evening landscape. The river lay quiet beside the empty
  3589	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the
  3590	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLucan road. What an end! The whole narrative of her death revolted him
  3591	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he
  3592	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld sacred. The threadbare phrases, the inane expressions of sympathy,
  3593	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the details of
  3594	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta commonplace vulgar death attacked his stomach. Not merely had she
  3595	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdegraded herself; she had degraded him. He saw the squalid tract of her
  3596	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvice, miserable and malodorous. His soul’s companion! He thought of
  3597	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hobbling wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottles to
  3598	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe filled by the barman. Just God, what an end! Evidently she had been
  3599	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunfit to live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits,
  3600	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared. But that she
  3601	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould have sunk so low! Was it possible he had deceived himself
  3602	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso utterly about her? He remembered her outburst of that night and
  3603	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinterpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done. He had no
  3604	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifficulty now in approving of the course he had taken.
  3605	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3606	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought her hand
  3607	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttouched his. The shock which had first attacked his stomach was now
  3608	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattacking his nerves. He put on his overcoat and hat quickly and went
  3609	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout. The cold air met him on the threshold; it crept into the sleeves of
  3610	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this coat. When he came to the public-house at Chapelizod Bridge he went
  3611	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin and ordered a hot punch.
  3612	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3613	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk.
  3614	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a
  3615	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentleman’s estate in County Kildare. They drank at intervals from their
  3616	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thuge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often on the floor and sometimes
  3617	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots. Mr Duffy
  3618	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsat on his stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing them.
  3619	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a while they went out and he called for another punch. He sat a
  3620	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong time over it. The shop was very quiet. The proprietor sprawled on
  3621	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe counter reading the _Herald_ and yawning. Now and again a tram was
  3622	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theard swishing along the lonely road outside.
  3623	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3624	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs he sat there, living over his life with her and evoking alternately
  3625	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe two images in which he now conceived her, he realised that she was
  3626	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead, that she had ceased to exist, that she had become a memory. He
  3627	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to feel ill at ease. He asked himself what else could he have
  3628	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdone. He could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her; he
  3629	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould not have lived with her openly. He had done what seemed to him
  3630	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbest. How was he to blame? Now that she was gone he understood how
  3631	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlonely her life must have been, sitting night after night alone in that
  3632	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom. His life would be lonely too until he, too, died, ceased to exist,
  3633	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecame a memory--if anyone remembered him.
  3634	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3635	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was after nine o’clock when he left the shop. The night was cold and
  3636	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgloomy. He entered the Park by the first gate and walked along under the
  3637	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgaunt trees. He walked through the bleak alleys where they had walked
  3638	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfour years before. She seemed to be near him in the darkness. At moments
  3639	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the seemed to feel her voice touch his ear, her hand touch his. He stood
  3640	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill to listen. Why had he withheld life from her? Why had he sentenced
  3641	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther to death? He felt his moral nature falling to pieces.
  3642	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3643	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen he gained the crest of the Magazine Hill he halted and looked
  3644	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong the river towards Dublin, the lights of which burned redly and
  3645	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thospitably in the cold night. He looked down the slope and, at the base,
  3646	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the shadow of the wall of the Park, he saw some human figures lying.
  3647	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThose venal and furtive loves filled him with despair. He gnawed the
  3648	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trectitude of his life; he felt that he had been outcast from life’s
  3649	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeast. One human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life
  3650	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand happiness: he had sentenced her to ignominy, a death of shame. He
  3651	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew that the prostrate creatures down by the wall were watching him and
  3652	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twished him gone. No one wanted him; he was outcast from life’s feast.
  3653	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned his eyes to the grey gleaming river, winding along towards
  3654	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin. Beyond the river he saw a goods train winding out of Kingsbridge
  3655	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStation, like a worm with a fiery head winding through the darkness,
  3656	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobstinately and laboriously. It passed slowly out of sight; but still
  3657	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the heard in his ears the laborious drone of the engine reiterating the
  3658	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsyllables of her name.
  3659	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3660	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned back the way he had come, the rhythm of the engine pounding
  3661	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin his ears. He began to doubt the reality of what memory told him. He
  3662	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away. He could not
  3663	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeel her near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear. He
  3664	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaited for some minutes listening. He could hear nothing: the night was
  3665	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfectly silent. He listened again: perfectly silent. He felt that he
  3666	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas alone.
  3667	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3668	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3669	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3670	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIVY DAY IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM
  3671	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3672	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOLD JACK raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread
  3673	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem judiciously over the whitening dome of coals. When the dome was
  3674	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but, as he set himself to
  3675	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfan the fire again, his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and
  3676	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this face slowly re-emerged into light. It was an old man’s face, very
  3677	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbony and hairy. The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist
  3678	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically when
  3679	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit closed. When the cinders had caught he laid the piece of cardboard
  3680	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst the wall, sighed and said:
  3681	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3682	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s better now, Mr O’Connor.”
  3683	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3684	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured by many
  3685	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblotches and pimples, had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette
  3686	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork
  3687	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeditatively. Then he began to roll the tobacco again meditatively and
  3688	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter a moment’s thought decided to lick the paper.
  3689	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3690	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did Mr Tierney say when he’d be back?” he asked in a husky falsetto.
  3691	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3692	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He didn’t say.”
  3693	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3694	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began to search his
  3695	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpockets. He took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards.
  3696	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3697	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll get you a match,” said the old man.
  3698	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3699	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Never mind, this’ll do,” said Mr O’Connor.
  3700	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3701	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it:
  3702	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3703	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3704	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ---------- ROYAL EXCHANGE WARD ----------
  3705	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3706	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Richard J. Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the favour of your
  3707	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvote and influence at the coming election in the Royal Exchange Ward.
  3708	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3709	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3710	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t----------
  3711	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3712	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor had been engaged by Tierney’s agent to canvass one part of
  3713	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ward but, as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the wet,
  3714	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the Committee
  3715	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRoom in Wicklow Street with Jack, the old caretaker. They had been
  3716	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsitting thus since the short day had grown dark. It was the sixth of
  3717	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOctober, dismal and cold out of doors.
  3718	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3719	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his
  3720	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy in
  3721	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lapel of his coat. The old man watched him attentively and then,
  3722	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaking up the piece of cardboard again, began to fan the fire slowly
  3723	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile his companion smoked.
  3724	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3725	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, yes,” he said, continuing, “it’s hard to know what way to bring
  3726	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup children. Now who’d think he’d turn out like that! I sent him to the
  3727	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChristian Brothers and I done what I could for him, and there he goes
  3728	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboosing about. I tried to make him someway decent.”
  3729	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3730	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe replaced the cardboard wearily.
  3731	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3732	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Only I’m an old man now I’d change his tune for him. I’d take the stick
  3733	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his back and beat him while I could stand over him--as I done many
  3734	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta time before. The mother, you know, she cocks him up with this and
  3735	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat....”
  3736	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3737	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s what ruins children,” said Mr O’Connor.
  3738	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3739	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To be sure it is,” said the old man. “And little thanks you get for it,
  3740	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonly impudence. He takes th’upper hand of me whenever he sees I’ve a
  3741	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsup taken. What’s the world coming to when sons speaks that way to their
  3742	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather?”
  3743	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3744	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What age is he?” said Mr O’Connor.
  3745	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3746	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Nineteen,” said the old man.
  3747	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3748	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why don’t you put him to something?”
  3749	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3750	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sure, amn’t I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left
  3751	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool? ‘I won’t keep you,’ I says. ‘You must get a job for yourself.’
  3752	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut, sure, it’s worse whenever he gets a job; he drinks it all.”
  3753	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3754	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor shook his head in sympathy, and the old man fell silent,
  3755	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgazing into the fire. Someone opened the door of the room and called
  3756	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout:
  3757	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3758	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hello! Is this a Freemasons’ meeting?”
  3759	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3760	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who’s that?” said the old man.
  3761	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3762	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What are you doing in the dark?” asked a voice.
  3763	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3764	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that you, Hynes?” asked Mr O’Connor.
  3765	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3766	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. What are you doing in the dark?” said Mr Hynes. advancing into the
  3767	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlight of the fire.
  3768	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3769	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a tall, slender young man with a light brown moustache. Imminent
  3770	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and the collar of his
  3771	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjacket-coat was turned up.
  3772	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3773	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Mat,” he said to Mr O’Connor, “how goes it?”
  3774	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3775	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor shook his head. The old man left the hearth and, after
  3776	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which he thrust
  3777	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone after the other into the fire and carried to the table. A denuded
  3778	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom came into view and the fire lost all its cheerful colour. The walls
  3779	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the room were bare except for a copy of an election address. In the
  3780	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmiddle of the room was a small table on which papers were heaped.
  3781	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3782	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked:
  3783	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3784	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Has he paid you yet?”
  3785	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3786	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not yet,” said Mr O’Connor. “I hope to God he’ll not leave us in the
  3787	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlurch tonight.”
  3788	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3789	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes laughed.
  3790	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3791	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, he’ll pay you. Never fear,” he said.
  3792	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3793	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I hope he’ll look smart about it if he means business,” said Mr
  3794	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Connor.
  3795	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3796	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What do you think, Jack?” said Mr Hynes satirically to the old man.
  3797	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3798	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man returned to his seat by the fire, saying:
  3799	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3800	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It isn’t but he has it, anyway. Not like the other tinker.”
  3801	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3802	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What other tinker?” said Mr Hynes.
  3803	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3804	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Colgan,” said the old man scornfully.
  3805	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3806	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It is because Colgan’s a working-man you say that? What’s the
  3807	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican--eh? Hasn’t
  3808	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe working-man as good a right to be in the Corporation as anyone
  3809	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\telse--ay, and a better right than those shoneens that are always hat in
  3810	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thand before any fellow with a handle to his name? Isn’t that so, Mat?”
  3811	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t said Mr Hynes, addressing Mr O’Connor.
  3812	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3813	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I think you’re right,” said Mr O’Connor.
  3814	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3815	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“One man is a plain honest man with no hunker-sliding about him. He goes
  3816	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin to represent the labour classes. This fellow you’re working for only
  3817	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twants to get some job or other.”
  3818	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3819	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course, the working-classes should be represented,” said the old
  3820	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman.
  3821	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3822	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The working-man,” said Mr Hynes, “gets all kicks and no halfpence. But
  3823	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit’s labour produces everything. The working-man is not looking for fat
  3824	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjobs for his sons and nephews and cousins. The working-man is not going
  3825	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto drag the honour of Dublin in the mud to please a German monarch.”
  3826	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3827	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How’s that?” said the old man.
  3828	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3829	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Don’t you know they want to present an address of welcome to Edward
  3830	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRex if he comes here next year? What do we want kowtowing to a foreign
  3831	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tking?”
  3832	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3833	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Our man won’t vote for the address,” said Mr O’Connor. “He goes in on
  3834	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Nationalist ticket.”
  3835	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3836	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Won’t he?” said Mr Hynes. “Wait till you see whether he will or not. I
  3837	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow him. Is it Tricky Dicky Tierney?”
  3838	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3839	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“By God! perhaps you’re right, Joe,” said Mr O’Connor. “Anyway, I wish
  3840	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the’d turn up with the spondulics.”
  3841	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3842	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe three men fell silent. The old man began to rake more cinders
  3843	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether. Mr Hynes took off his hat, shook it and then turned down the
  3844	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollar of his coat, displaying, as he did so, an ivy leaf in the lapel.
  3845	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3846	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If this man was alive,” he said, pointing to the leaf, “we’d have no
  3847	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalk of an address of welcome.”
  3848	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3849	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s true,” said Mr O’Connor.
  3850	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3851	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Musha, God be with them times!” said the old man. “There was some life
  3852	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin it then.”
  3853	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3854	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe room was silent again. Then a bustling little man with a snuffling
  3855	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnose and very cold ears pushed in the door. He walked over quickly to
  3856	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fire, rubbing his hands as if he intended to produce a spark from
  3857	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem.
  3858	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3859	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No money, boys,” he said.
  3860	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3861	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sit down here, Mr Henchy,” said the old man, offering him his chair.
  3862	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3863	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, don’t stir, Jack, don’t stir,” said Mr Henchy.
  3864	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3865	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe nodded curtly to Mr Hynes and sat down on the chair which the old man
  3866	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvacated.
  3867	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3868	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did you serve Aungier Street?” he asked Mr O’Connor.
  3869	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3870	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr O’Connor, beginning to search his pockets for memoranda.
  3871	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3872	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did you call on Grimes?”
  3873	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3874	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I did.”
  3875	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3876	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well? How does he stand?”
  3877	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3878	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He wouldn’t promise. He said: ‘I won’t tell anyone what way I’m going
  3879	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto vote.’ But I think he’ll be all right.”
  3880	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3881	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why so?”
  3882	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3883	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He asked me who the nominators were; and I told him. I mentioned Father
  3884	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBurke’s name. I think it’ll be all right.”
  3885	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3886	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hands over the fire at a
  3887	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterrific speed. Then he said:
  3888	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3889	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“For the love of God, Jack, bring us a bit of coal. There must be some
  3890	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleft.”
  3891	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3892	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man went out of the room.
  3893	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3894	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s no go,” said Mr Henchy, shaking his head. “I asked the little
  3895	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshoeboy, but he said: ‘Oh, now, Mr Henchy, when I see work going on
  3896	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproperly I won’t forget you, you may be sure.’ Mean little tinker!
  3897	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t‘Usha, how could he be anything else?”
  3898	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3899	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What did I tell you, Mat?” said Mr Hynes. “Tricky Dicky Tierney.”
  3900	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3901	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, he’s as tricky as they make ‘em,” said Mr Henchy. “He hasn’t got
  3902	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose little pigs’ eyes for nothing. Blast his soul! Couldn’t he pay
  3903	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup like a man instead of: ‘O, now, Mr Henchy, I must speak to Mr
  3904	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFanning.... I’ve spent a lot of money’? Mean little shoeboy of hell! I
  3905	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppose he forgets the time his little old father kept the hand-me-down
  3906	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop in Mary’s Lane.”
  3907	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3908	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But is that a fact?” asked Mr O’Connor.
  3909	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3910	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God, yes,” said Mr Henchy. “Did you never hear that? And the men
  3911	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused to go in on Sunday morning before the houses were open to buy a
  3912	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaistcoat or a trousers--moya! But Tricky Dicky’s little old father
  3913	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner. Do you mind now?
  3914	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’s that. That’s where he first saw the light.”
  3915	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3916	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he placed here and
  3917	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere on the fire.
  3918	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3919	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thats a nice how-do-you-do,” said Mr O’Connor. “How does he expect us
  3920	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto work for him if he won’t stump up?”
  3921	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3922	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I can’t help it,” said Mr Henchy. “I expect to find the bailiffs in the
  3923	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thall when I go home.”
  3924	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3925	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes laughed and, shoving himself away from the mantelpiece with the
  3926	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taid of his shoulders, made ready to leave.
  3927	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3928	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’ll be all right when King Eddie comes,” he said. “Well boys, I’m off
  3929	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the present. See you later. ‘Bye, ‘bye.”
  3930	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3931	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went out of the room slowly. Neither Mr Henchy nor the old man said
  3932	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything but, just as the door was closing, Mr O’Connor, who had been
  3933	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstaring moodily into the fire, called out suddenly:
  3934	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3935	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘Bye, Joe.”
  3936	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3937	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the direction of the
  3938	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor.
  3939	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3940	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me,” he said across the fire, “what brings our friend in here?
  3941	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat does he want?”
  3942	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3943	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘Usha, poor Joe!” said Mr O’Connor, throwing the end of his cigarette
  3944	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the fire, “he’s hard up, like the rest of us.”
  3945	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3946	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he nearly put
  3947	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout the fire, which uttered a hissing protest.
  3948	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3949	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To tell you my private and candid opinion,” he said, “I think he’s a
  3950	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman from the other camp. He’s a spy of Colgan’s, if you ask me. Just go
  3951	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround and try and find out how they’re getting on. They won’t suspect
  3952	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou. Do you twig?”
  3953	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3954	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, poor Joe is a decent skin,” said Mr O’Connor.
  3955	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3956	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“His father was a decent respectable man,” Mr Henchy admitted. “Poor old
  3957	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLarry Hynes! Many a good turn he did in his day! But I’m greatly afraid
  3958	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour friend is not nineteen carat. Damn it, I can understand a fellow
  3959	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing hard up, but what I can’t understand is a fellow sponging.
  3960	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCouldn’t he have some spark of manhood about him?”
  3961	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3962	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He doesn’t get a warm welcome from me when he comes,” said the old man.
  3963	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Let him work for his own side and not come spying around here.”
  3964	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3965	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t know,” said Mr O’Connor dubiously, as he took out
  3966	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigarette-papers and tobacco. “I think Joe Hynes is a straight man.
  3967	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe’s a clever chap, too, with the pen. Do you remember that thing he
  3968	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrote...?”
  3969	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3970	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Some of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if you ask
  3971	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme,” said Mr Henchy. “Do you know what my private and candid opinion is
  3972	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout some of those little jokers? I believe half of them are in the pay
  3973	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Castle.”
  3974	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3975	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s no knowing,” said the old man.
  3976	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3977	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, but I know it for a fact,” said Mr Henchy. “They’re Castle hacks....
  3978	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI don’t say Hynes.... No, damn it, I think he’s a stroke above that....
  3979	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut there’s a certain little nobleman with a cock-eye--you know the
  3980	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpatriot I’m alluding to?”
  3981	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3982	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor nodded.
  3983	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3984	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s a lineal descendant of Major Sirr for you if you like! O, the
  3985	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart’s blood of a patriot! That’s a fellow now that’d sell his country
  3986	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor fourpence--ay--and go down on his bended knees and thank the
  3987	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlmighty Christ he had a country to sell.”
  3988	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3989	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a knock at the door.
  3990	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3991	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come in!” said Mr Henchy.
  3992	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3993	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the
  3994	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoorway. His black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body
  3995	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman’s collar or
  3996	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta layman’s, because the collar of his shabby frock-coat, the uncovered
  3997	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuttons of which reflected the candlelight, was turned up about his
  3998	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tneck. He wore a round hat of hard black felt. His face, shining with
  3999	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\traindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy
  4000	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspots indicated the cheekbones. He opened his very long mouth suddenly
  4001	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very
  4002	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise.
  4003	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4004	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O Father Keon!” said Mr Henchy, jumping up from his chair. “Is that
  4005	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou? Come in!”
  4006	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4007	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, no, no, no!” said Father Keon quickly, pursing his lips as if he
  4008	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere addressing a child.
  4009	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4010	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Won’t you come in and sit down?”
  4011	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4012	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no, no!” said Father Keon, speaking in a discreet indulgent
  4013	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvelvety voice. “Don’t let me disturb you now! I’m just looking for Mr
  4014	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFanning....”
  4015	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4016	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He’s round at the _Black Eagle_,” said Mr Henchy. “But won’t you come
  4017	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin and sit down a minute?”
  4018	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4019	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no, thank you. It was just a little business matter,” said Father
  4020	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKeon. “Thank you, indeed.”
  4021	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4022	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe retreated from the doorway and Mr Henchy, seizing one of the
  4023	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandlesticks, went to the door to light him downstairs.
  4024	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4025	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, don’t trouble, I beg!”
  4026	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4027	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, but the stairs is so dark.”
  4028	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4029	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no, I can see.... Thank you, indeed.”
  4030	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4031	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you right now?”
  4032	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4033	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All right, thanks.... Thanks.”
  4034	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4035	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the table. He sat
  4036	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown again at the fire. There was silence for a few moments.
  4037	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4038	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me, John,” said Mr O’Connor, lighting his cigarette with another
  4039	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpasteboard card.
  4040	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4041	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hm?”
  4042	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4043	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What he is exactly?”
  4044	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4045	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ask me an easier one,” said Mr Henchy.
  4046	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4047	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Fanning and himself seem to me very thick. They’re often in Kavanagh’s
  4048	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether. Is he a priest at all?”
  4049	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4050	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mmmyes, I believe so.... I think he’s what you call a black sheep.
  4051	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe haven’t many of them, thank God! but we have a few.... He’s an
  4052	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunfortunate man of some kind....”
  4053	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4054	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And how does he knock it out?” asked Mr O’Connor.
  4055	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4056	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s another mystery.”
  4057	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4058	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is he attached to any chapel or church or institution or----”
  4059	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4060	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” said Mr Henchy, “I think he’s travelling on his own account....
  4061	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod forgive me,” he added, “I thought he was the dozen of stout.”
  4062	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4063	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is there any chance of a drink itself?” asked Mr O’Connor.
  4064	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4065	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m dry too,” said the old man.
  4066	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4067	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I asked that little shoeboy three times,” said Mr Henchy, “would he
  4068	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsend up a dozen of stout. I asked him again now, but he was leaning
  4069	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the counter in his shirt-sleeves having a deep goster with Alderman
  4070	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCowley.”
  4071	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4072	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why didn’t you remind him?” said Mr O’Connor.
  4073	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4074	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I couldn’t go over while he was talking to Alderman Cowley. I
  4075	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust waited till I caught his eye, and said: ‘About that little matter
  4076	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI was speaking to you about....’ ‘That’ll be all right, Mr H.,’ he said.
  4077	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYerra, sure the little hop-o’-my-thumb has forgotten all about it.”
  4078	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4079	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s some deal on in that quarter,” said Mr O’Connor thoughtfully.
  4080	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at Suffolk Street corner.”
  4081	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4082	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I think I know the little game they’re at,” said Mr Henchy. “You must
  4083	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\towe the City Fathers money nowadays if you want to be made Lord Mayor.
  4084	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen they’ll make you Lord Mayor. By God! I’m thinking seriously of
  4085	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecoming a City Father myself. What do you think? Would I do for the
  4086	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjob?”
  4087	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4088	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor laughed.
  4089	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4090	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So far as owing money goes....”
  4091	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4092	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Driving out of the Mansion House,” said Mr Henchy, “in all my vermin,
  4093	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Jack here standing up behind me in a powdered wig--eh?”
  4094	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4095	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And make me your private secretary, John.”
  4096	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4097	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. And I’ll make Father Keon my private chaplain. We’ll have a family
  4098	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparty.”
  4099	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4100	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Faith, Mr Henchy,” said the old man, “you’d keep up better style than
  4101	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome of them. I was talking one day to old Keegan, the porter. ‘And
  4102	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow do you like your new master, Pat?’ says I to him. ‘You haven’t much
  4103	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentertaining now,’ says I. ‘Entertaining!’ says he. ‘He’d live on the
  4104	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmell of an oil-rag.’ And do you know what he told me? Now, I declare to
  4105	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod I didn’t believe him.”
  4106	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4107	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What?” said Mr Henchy and Mr O’Connor.
  4108	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4109	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He told me: ‘What do you think of a Lord Mayor of Dublin sending out
  4110	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a pound of chops for his dinner? How’s that for high living?’ says
  4111	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the. ‘Wisha! wisha,’ says I. ‘A pound of chops,’ says he, ‘coming into
  4112	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Mansion House.’ ‘Wisha!’ says I, ‘what kind of people is going at
  4113	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall now?’”
  4114	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4115	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt this point there was a knock at the door, and a boy put in his head.
  4116	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4117	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is it?” said the old man.
  4118	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4119	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“From the _Black Eagle_,” said the boy, walking in sideways and
  4120	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdepositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken bottles.
  4121	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4122	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the basket to
  4123	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe table and counted the full tally. After the transfer the boy put his
  4124	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbasket on his arm and asked:
  4125	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4126	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Any bottles?”
  4127	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4128	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What bottles?” said the old man.
  4129	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4130	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Won’t you let us drink them first?” said Mr Henchy.
  4131	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4132	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was told to ask for the bottles.”
  4133	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4134	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come back tomorrow,” said the old man.
  4135	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4136	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here, boy!” said Mr Henchy, “will you run over to O’Farrell’s and ask
  4137	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim to lend us a corkscrew--for Mr Henchy, say. Tell him we won’t keep
  4138	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit a minute. Leave the basket there.”
  4139	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4140	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boy went out and Mr Henchy began to rub his hands cheerfully,
  4141	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaying:
  4142	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4143	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well, he’s not so bad after all. He’s as good as his word, anyhow.”
  4144	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4145	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s no tumblers,” said the old man.
  4146	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4147	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, don’t let that trouble you, Jack,” said Mr Henchy. “Many’s the good
  4148	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman before now drank out of the bottle.”
  4149	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4150	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Anyway, it’s better than nothing,” said Mr O’Connor.
  4151	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4152	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He’s not a bad sort,” said Mr Henchy, “only Fanning has such a loan of
  4153	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. He means well, you know, in his own tinpot way.”
  4154	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4155	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boy came back with the corkscrew. The old man opened three bottles
  4156	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand was handing back the corkscrew when Mr Henchy said to the boy:
  4157	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4158	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Would you like a drink, boy?”
  4159	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4160	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If you please, sir,” said the boy.
  4161	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4162	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man opened another bottle grudgingly, and handed it to the boy.
  4163	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4164	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What age are you?” he asked.
  4165	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4166	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Seventeen,” said the boy.
  4167	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4168	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the old man said nothing further, the boy took the bottle and said:
  4169	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here’s my best respects, sir,” to Mr Henchy, drank the contents, put
  4170	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Then
  4171	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the took up the corkscrew and went out of the door sideways, muttering
  4172	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome form of salutation.
  4173	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4174	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s the way it begins,” said the old man.
  4175	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4176	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The thin edge of the wedge,” said Mr Henchy.
  4177	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4178	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened and the
  4179	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmen drank from them simultaneously. After having drunk each placed his
  4180	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottle on the mantelpiece within hand’s reach and drew in a long breath
  4181	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof satisfaction.
  4182	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4183	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I did a good day’s work today,” said Mr Henchy, after a pause.
  4184	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4185	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That so, John?”
  4186	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4187	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. I got him one or two sure things in Dawson Street, Crofton and
  4188	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmyself. Between ourselves, you know, Crofton (he’s a decent chap, of
  4189	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse), but he’s not worth a damn as a canvasser. He hasn’t a word
  4190	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto throw to a dog. He stands and looks at the people while I do the
  4191	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking.”
  4192	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4193	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHere two men entered the room. One of them was a very fat man whose blue
  4194	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tserge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping figure.
  4195	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had a big face which resembled a young ox’s face in expression,
  4196	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstaring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache. The other man, who was much
  4197	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyounger and frailer, had a thin, clean-shaven face. He wore a very high
  4198	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdouble collar and a wide-brimmed bowler hat.
  4199	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4200	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hello, Crofton!” said Mr Henchy to the fat man. “Talk of the devil....”
  4201	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4202	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where did the boose come from?” asked the young man. “Did the cow
  4203	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalve?”
  4204	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4205	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, of course, Lyons spots the drink first thing!” said Mr O’Connor,
  4206	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing.
  4207	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4208	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that the way you chaps canvass,” said Mr Lyons, “and Crofton and I
  4209	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout in the cold and rain looking for votes?”
  4210	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4211	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why, blast your soul,” said Mr Henchy, “I’d get more votes in five
  4212	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminutes than you two’d get in a week.”
  4213	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4214	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Open two bottles of stout, Jack,” said Mr O’Connor.
  4215	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4216	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How can I?” said the old man, “when there’s no corkscrew?”
  4217	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4218	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Wait now, wait now!” said Mr Henchy, getting up quickly. “Did you ever
  4219	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee this little trick?”
  4220	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4221	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the fire, put
  4222	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem on the hob. Then he sat down again by the fire and took another
  4223	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrink from his bottle. Mr Lyons sat on the edge of the table, pushed his
  4224	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\that towards the nape of his neck and began to swing his legs.
  4225	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4226	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Which is my bottle?” he asked.
  4227	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4228	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“This lad,” said Mr Henchy.
  4229	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4230	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on
  4231	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hob. He was silent for two reasons. The first reason, sufficient in
  4232	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\titself, was that he had nothing to say; the second reason was that
  4233	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the considered his companions beneath him. He had been a canvasser for
  4234	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWilkins, the Conservative, but when the Conservatives had withdrawn
  4235	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir man and, choosing the lesser of two evils, given their support to
  4236	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Nationalist candidate, he had been engaged to work for Mr Tierney.
  4237	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4238	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn a few minutes an apologetic “Pok!” was heard as the cork flew out of
  4239	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Lyons’ bottle. Mr Lyons jumped off the table, went to the fire, took
  4240	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this bottle and carried it back to the table.
  4241	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4242	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was just telling them, Crofton,” said Mr Henchy, “that we got a good
  4243	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfew votes today.”
  4244	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4245	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who did you get?” asked Mr Lyons.
  4246	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4247	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I got Parkes for one, and I got Atkinson for two, and got Ward
  4248	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Dawson Street. Fine old chap he is, too--regular old toff, old
  4249	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConservative! ‘But isn’t your candidate a Nationalist?’ said he. ‘He’s a
  4250	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trespectable man,’ said I. ‘He’s in favour of whatever will benefit this
  4251	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcountry. He’s a big ratepayer,’ I said. ‘He has extensive house property
  4252	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the city and three places of business and isn’t it to his own
  4253	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvantage to keep down the rates? He’s a prominent and respected
  4254	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcitizen,’ said I, ‘and a Poor Law Guardian, and he doesn’t belong to any
  4255	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparty, good, bad, or indifferent.’ That’s the way to talk to ‘em.”
  4256	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4257	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what about the address to the King?” said Mr Lyons, after drinking
  4258	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand smacking his lips.
  4259	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4260	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Listen to me,” said Mr Henchy. “What we want in this country, as I said
  4261	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto old Ward, is capital. The King’s coming here will mean an influx of
  4262	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney into this country. The citizens of Dublin will benefit by it.
  4263	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLook at all the factories down by the quays there, idle! Look at all the
  4264	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney there is in the country if we only worked the old industries, the
  4265	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmills, the ship-building yards and factories. It’s capital we want.”
  4266	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4267	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But look here, John,” said Mr O’Connor. “Why should we welcome the King
  4268	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof England? Didn’t Parnell himself....”
  4269	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4270	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Parnell,” said Mr Henchy, “is dead. Now, here’s the way I look at it.
  4271	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHere’s this chap come to the throne after his old mother keeping him out
  4272	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof it till the man was grey. He’s a man of the world, and he means
  4273	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell by us. He’s a jolly fine decent fellow, if you ask me, and no damn
  4274	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnonsense about him. He just says to himself: ‘The old one never went
  4275	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto see these wild Irish. By Christ, I’ll go myself and see what they’re
  4276	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike.’ And are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a
  4277	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriendly visit? Eh? Isn’t that right, Crofton?”
  4278	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4279	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Crofton nodded his head.
  4280	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4281	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But after all now,” said Mr Lyons argumentatively, “King Edward’s life,
  4282	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou know, is not the very....”
  4283	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4284	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Let bygones be bygones,” said Mr Henchy. “I admire the man personally.
  4285	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe’s just an ordinary knockabout like you and me. He’s fond of his glass
  4286	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof grog and he’s a bit of a rake, perhaps, and he’s a good sportsman.
  4287	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDamn it, can’t we Irish play fair?”
  4288	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4289	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s all very fine,” said Mr Lyons. “But look at the case of Parnell
  4290	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow.”
  4291	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4292	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“In the name of God,” said Mr Henchy, “where’s the analogy between the
  4293	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo cases?”
  4294	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4295	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What I mean,” said Mr Lyons, “is we have our ideals. Why, now, would we
  4296	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twelcome a man like that? Do you think now after what he did Parnell
  4297	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a fit man to lead us? And why, then, would we do it for Edward the
  4298	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSeventh?”
  4299	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4300	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“This is Parnell’s anniversary,” said Mr O’Connor, “and don’t let
  4301	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus stir up any bad blood. We all respect him now that he’s dead and
  4302	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone--even the Conservatives,” he added, turning to Mr Crofton.
  4303	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4304	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPok! The tardy cork flew out of Mr Crofton’s bottle. Mr Crofton got up
  4305	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom his box and went to the fire. As he returned with his capture he
  4306	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid in a deep voice:
  4307	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4308	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Our side of the house respects him, because he was a gentleman.”
  4309	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4310	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Right you are, Crofton!” said Mr Henchy fiercely. “He was the only man
  4311	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat could keep that bag of cats in order. ‘Down, ye dogs! Lie down, ye
  4312	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurs!’ That’s the way he treated them. Come in, Joe! Come in!” he called
  4313	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout, catching sight of Mr Hynes in the doorway.
  4314	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4315	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes came in slowly.
  4316	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4317	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Open another bottle of stout, Jack,” said Mr Henchy. “O, I forgot
  4318	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere’s no corkscrew! Here, show me one here and I’ll put it at the
  4319	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfire.”
  4320	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4321	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the hob.
  4322	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4323	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sit down, Joe,” said Mr O’Connor, “we’re just talking about the Chief.”
  4324	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4325	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ay, ay!” said Mr Henchy.
  4326	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4327	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr Lyons but said nothing.
  4328	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4329	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s one of them, anyhow,” said Mr Henchy, “that didn’t renege him.
  4330	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy God, I’ll say for you, Joe! No, by God, you stuck to him like a man!”
  4331	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4332	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Joe,” said Mr O’Connor suddenly. “Give us that thing you wrote--do
  4333	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou remember? Have you got it on you?”
  4334	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4335	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, ay!” said Mr Henchy. “Give us that. Did you ever hear that, Crofton?
  4336	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tListen to this now: splendid thing.”
  4337	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4338	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Go on,” said Mr O’Connor. “Fire away, Joe.”
  4339	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4340	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were
  4341	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talluding but, after reflecting a while, he said:
  4342	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4343	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, that thing is it.... Sure, that’s old now.”
  4344	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4345	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Out with it, man!” said Mr O’Connor.
  4346	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4347	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘Sh, ‘sh,” said Mr Henchy. “Now, Joe!”
  4348	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4349	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes hesitated a little longer. Then amid the silence he took off
  4350	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to be rehearsing
  4351	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he announced:
  4352	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4353	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4354	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE DEATH OF PARNELL _6th October_ 1891
  4355	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4356	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite:
  4357	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4358	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4359	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead. O, Erin, mourn with grief and
  4360	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoe For he lies dead whom the fell gang Of modern hypocrites laid low.
  4361	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4362	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe lies slain by the coward hounds He raised to glory from the mire; And
  4363	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tErin’s hopes and Erin’s dreams Perish upon her monarch’s pyre.
  4364	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4365	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn palace, cabin or in cot The Irish heart where’er it be Is bowed with
  4366	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoe--for he is gone Who would have wrought her destiny.
  4367	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4368	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe would have had his Erin famed, The green flag gloriously unfurled,
  4369	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer statesmen, bards and warriors raised Before the nations of the
  4370	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWorld.
  4371	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4372	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe dreamed (alas, ‘twas but a dream!) Of Liberty: but as he strove To
  4373	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclutch that idol, treachery Sundered him from the thing he loved.
  4374	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4375	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShame on the coward, caitiff hands That smote their Lord or with a kiss
  4376	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBetrayed him to the rabble-rout Of fawning priests--no friends of his.
  4377	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4378	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMay everlasting shame consume The memory of those who tried To befoul
  4379	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand smear the exalted name Of one who spurned them in his pride.
  4380	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4381	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe fell as fall the mighty ones, Nobly undaunted to the last, And death
  4382	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas now united him With Erin’s heroes of the past.
  4383	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4384	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo sound of strife disturb his sleep! Calmly he rests: no human pain Or
  4385	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh ambition spurs him now The peaks of glory to attain.
  4386	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4387	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey had their way: they laid him low. But Erin, list, his spirit may
  4388	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRise, like the Phœnix from the flames, When breaks the dawning of
  4389	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe day,
  4390	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4391	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe day that brings us Freedom’s reign. And on that day may Erin well
  4392	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPledge in the cup she lifts to Joy One grief--the memory of Parnell.
  4393	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4394	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes sat down again on the table. When he had finished his
  4395	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping: even Mr
  4396	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLyons clapped. The applause continued for a little time. When it had
  4397	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in silence.
  4398	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4399	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPok! The cork flew out of Mr Hynes’ bottle, but Mr Hynes remained
  4400	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsitting flushed and bareheaded on the table. He did not seem to have
  4401	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theard the invitation.
  4402	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4403	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good man, Joe!” said Mr O’Connor, taking out his cigarette papers and
  4404	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpouch the better to hide his emotion.
  4405	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4406	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What do you think of that, Crofton?” cried Mr Henchy. “Isn’t that fine?
  4407	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat?”
  4408	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4409	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing.
  4410	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4411	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4412	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4413	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA MOTHER
  4414	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4415	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMR HOLOHAN, assistant secretary of the _Eire Abu_ Society, had been
  4416	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and
  4417	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of
  4418	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy
  4419	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHolohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street
  4420	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs
  4421	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney who arranged everything.
  4422	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4423	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Devlin had become Mrs Kearney out of spite. She had been educated
  4424	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As
  4425	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at
  4426	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool. When she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many
  4427	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouses where her playing and ivory manners were much admired. She sat
  4428	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamid the chilly circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor
  4429	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto brave it and offer her a brilliant life. But the young men whom she
  4430	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmet were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console
  4431	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in
  4432	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecret. However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began
  4433	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr
  4434	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay.
  4435	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4436	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took
  4437	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of
  4438	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarried life, Mrs Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better
  4439	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away.
  4440	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first
  4441	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFriday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened
  4442	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange
  4443	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take
  4444	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt
  4445	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model
  4446	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for
  4447	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboth his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to
  4448	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe age of twenty-four. He sent the elder daughter, Kathleen, to a good
  4449	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconvent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid her
  4450	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfees at the Academy. Every year in the month of July Mrs Kearney found
  4451	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toccasion to say to some friend:
  4452	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4453	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.”
  4454	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4455	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIf it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones.
  4456	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4457	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs Kearney determined
  4458	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto take advantage of her daughter’s name and brought an Irish teacher to
  4459	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe house. Kathleen and her sister sent Irish picture postcards to their
  4460	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriends and these friends sent back other Irish picture postcards.
  4461	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn special Sundays, when Mr Kearney went with his family to the
  4462	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at
  4463	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe corner of Cathedral Street. They were all friends of the
  4464	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearneys--musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had
  4465	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplayed every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another
  4466	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said
  4467	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney
  4468	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to be heard often on people’s lips. People said that she was
  4469	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a
  4470	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeliever in the language movement. Mrs Kearney was well content at this.
  4471	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTherefore she was not surprised when one day Mr Holohan came to her and
  4472	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of
  4473	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfour grand concerts which his Society was going to give in the Antient
  4474	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConcert Rooms. She brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down
  4475	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. She
  4476	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and
  4477	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to
  4478	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treceive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand
  4479	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcerts.
  4480	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4481	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs Mr Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of
  4482	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs Kearney helped
  4483	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. She had tact. She knew what _artistes_ should go into capitals and
  4484	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat _artistes_ should go into small type. She knew that the first
  4485	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttenor would not like to come on after Mr Meade’s comic turn. To keep the
  4486	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taudience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between
  4487	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe old favourites. Mr Holohan called to see her every day to have her
  4488	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvice on some point. She was invariably friendly and advising--homely,
  4489	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin fact. She pushed the decanter towards him, saying:
  4490	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4491	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, help yourself, Mr Holohan!”
  4492	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4493	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd while he was helping himself she said:
  4494	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4495	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid of it!”
  4496	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4497	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEverything went on smoothly. Mrs Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink
  4498	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharmeuse in Brown Thomas’s to let into the front of Kathleen’s dress.
  4499	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense
  4500	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis justifiable. She took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final
  4501	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come
  4502	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\totherwise. She forgot nothing and, thanks to her, everything that was to
  4503	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe done was done.
  4504	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4505	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
  4506	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen Mrs Kearney arrived with her daughter at the Antient Concert Rooms
  4507	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton Wednesday night she did not like the look of things. A few young men,
  4508	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the vestibule;
  4509	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnone of them wore evening dress. She passed by with her daughter and a
  4510	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of
  4511	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stewards’ idleness. At first she wondered had she mistaken the hour.
  4512	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo, it was twenty minutes to eight.
  4513	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4514	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the
  4515	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecretary of the Society, Mr Fitzpatrick. She smiled and shook his hand.
  4516	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a little man, with a white vacant face. She noticed that he
  4517	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that
  4518	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand and, while he was
  4519	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. He seemed
  4520	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto bear disappointments lightly. Mr Holohan came into the dressing-room
  4521	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery few minutes with reports from the box-office. The _artistes_
  4522	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at the
  4523	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmirror and rolled and unrolled their music. When it was nearly half-past
  4524	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teight, the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be
  4525	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentertained. Mr Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and
  4526	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
  4527	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4528	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we’d better open the ball.”
  4529	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4530	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of
  4531	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:
  4532	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4533	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you ready, dear?”
  4534	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4535	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen she had an opportunity, she called Mr Holohan aside and asked him
  4536	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto tell her what it meant. Mr Holohan did not know what it meant.
  4537	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe said that the Committee had made a mistake in arranging for four
  4538	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcerts: four was too many.
  4539	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4540	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And the _artistes_!” said Mrs Kearney. “Of course they are doing their
  4541	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbest, but really they are not good.”
  4542	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4543	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan admitted that the _artistes_ were no good but the Committee,
  4544	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased
  4545	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs Kearney said nothing,
  4546	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut, as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the
  4547	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfew people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret
  4548	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat she had put herself to any expense for such a concert. There was
  4549	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething she didn’t like in the look of things and Mr Fitzpatrick’s
  4550	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvacant smile irritated her very much. However, she said nothing and
  4551	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaited to see how it would end. The concert expired shortly before ten,
  4552	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand everyone went home quickly.
  4553	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4554	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs Kearney
  4555	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaw at once that the house was filled with paper. The audience behaved
  4556	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr
  4557	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs
  4558	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney was taking angry note of his conduct. He stood at the edge of
  4559	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a
  4560	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In the course
  4561	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the evening, Mrs Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be
  4562	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to
  4563	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought
  4564	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout Mr Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with
  4565	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes, it
  4566	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas true.
  4567	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4568	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But, of course, that doesn’t alter the contract,” she said. “The
  4569	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontract was for four concerts.”
  4570	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4571	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to Mr
  4572	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzpatrick. Mrs Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. She called
  4573	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had
  4574	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsigned for four concerts and that, of course, according to the terms
  4575	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the contract, she should receive the sum originally stipulated for,
  4576	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhether the society gave the four concerts or not. Mr Fitzpatrick, who
  4577	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve
  4578	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the
  4579	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCommittee. Mrs Kearney’s anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had
  4580	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall she could do to keep from asking:
  4581	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4582	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And who is the _Cometty_ pray?”
  4583	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4584	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was
  4585	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent.
  4586	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4587	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on
  4588	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFriday morning with bundles of handbills. Special puffs appeared in all
  4589	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe evening papers, reminding the music-loving public of the treat which
  4590	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas in store for it on the following evening. Mrs Kearney was somewhat
  4591	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treassured, but she thought well to tell her husband part of her
  4592	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuspicions. He listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be
  4593	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter if he went with her on Saturday night. She agreed. She respected
  4594	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as
  4595	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number
  4596	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was
  4597	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans over.
  4598	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4599	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe night of the grand concert came. Mrs Kearney, with her husband and
  4600	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour
  4601	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was
  4602	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta rainy evening. Mrs Kearney placed her daughter’s clothes and music
  4603	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for
  4604	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan or Mr Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the
  4605	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstewards was any member of the Committee in the hall and, after a great
  4606	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss
  4607	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeirne to whom Mrs Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the
  4608	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she
  4609	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo anything. Mrs Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was
  4610	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscrewed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered:
  4611	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4612	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, thank you!”
  4613	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4614	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out
  4615	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the
  4616	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a
  4617	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle sigh and said:
  4618	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4619	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well! We did our best, the dear knows.”
  4620	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4621	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room.
  4622	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4623	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe _artistes_ were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already
  4624	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome. The bass, Mr Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered
  4625	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblack moustache. He was the son of a hall porter in an office in the
  4626	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcity and, as a boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding
  4627	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thall. From this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a
  4628	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst-rate _artiste_. He had appeared in grand opera. One night, when
  4629	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan operatic _artiste_ had fallen ill, he had undertaken the part of
  4630	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe king in the opera of _Maritana_ at the Queen’s Theatre. He sang
  4631	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the
  4632	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgallery; but, unfortunately, he marred the good impression by wiping
  4633	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness. He
  4634	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas unassuming and spoke little. He said _yous_ so softly that it passed
  4635	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice’s
  4636	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsake. Mr Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man who
  4637	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompeted every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On his fourth trial he
  4638	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely nervous and extremely
  4639	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an
  4640	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tebullient friendliness. It was his humour to have people know what an
  4641	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tordeal a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr Duggan he went
  4642	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover to him and asked:
  4643	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4644	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you in it too?”
  4645	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4646	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Duggan.
  4647	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4648	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:
  4649	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4650	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Shake!”
  4651	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4652	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the
  4653	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscreen to view the house. The seats were being filled up rapidly and a
  4654	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She came back and spoke to
  4655	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther husband privately. Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen
  4656	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her
  4657	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNationalist friends, Miss Healy, the contralto. An unknown solitary
  4658	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman with a pale face walked through the room. The women followed with
  4659	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkeen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body.
  4660	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSomeone said that she was Madam Glynn, the soprano.
  4661	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4662	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wonder where did they dig her up,” said Kathleen to Miss Healy. “I’m
  4663	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsure I never heard of her.”
  4664	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4665	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Healy had to smile. Mr Holohan limped into the dressing-room at
  4666	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown
  4667	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman. Mr Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam Glynn
  4668	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttook her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly
  4669	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled
  4670	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgaze. The shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully
  4671	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the little cup behind her collar-bone. The noise of the hall became
  4672	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore audible. The first tenor and the baritone arrived together. They
  4673	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere both well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath
  4674	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof opulence among the company.
  4675	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4676	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them
  4677	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove
  4678	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be polite, her eyes followed Mr Holohan in his limping and devious
  4679	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after
  4680	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim.
  4681	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4682	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,” she said.
  4683	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4684	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked
  4685	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr
  4686	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn’t know
  4687	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything about Mr Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for
  4688	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it
  4689	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twasn’t his business.
  4690	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4691	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why isn’t it your business?” asked Mrs Kearney. “Didn’t you yourself
  4692	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbring her the contract? Anyway, if it’s not your business it’s my
  4693	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbusiness and I mean to see to it.”
  4694	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4695	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’d better speak to Mr Fitzpatrick,” said Mr Holohan distantly.
  4696	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4697	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick,” repeated Mrs Kearney. “I
  4698	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.”
  4699	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4700	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly
  4701	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken
  4702	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy
  4703	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the baritone. They were the _Freeman_ man and Mr O’Madden Burke. The
  4704	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Freeman_ man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert
  4705	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in
  4706	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Mansion House. He said they were to leave the report for him at the
  4707	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Freeman_ office and he would see that it went in. He was a grey-haired
  4708	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman, with a plausible voice and careful manners. He held an extinguished
  4709	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him. He had
  4710	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot intended to stay a moment because concerts and _artistes_ bored him
  4711	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsiderably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece. Miss
  4712	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHealy stood in front of him, talking and laughing. He was old enough to
  4713	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to
  4714	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturn the moment to account. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body
  4715	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappealed to his senses. He was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which
  4716	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment
  4717	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor him, that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his
  4718	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttribute. When he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully.
  4719	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4720	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O’Madden Burke will write the notice,” he explained to Mr Holohan, “and
  4721	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’ll see it in.”
  4722	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4723	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thank you very much, Mr Hendrick,” said Mr Holohan, “you’ll see it in,
  4724	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI know. Now, won’t you have a little something before you go?”
  4725	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4726	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t mind,” said Mr Hendrick.
  4727	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4728	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase
  4729	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking
  4730	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottles for a few gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was Mr O’Madden
  4731	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBurke, who had found out the room by instinct. He was a suave, elderly
  4732	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman who balanced his imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk
  4733	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tumbrella. His magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon
  4734	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he balanced the fine problem of his finances. He was widely
  4735	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trespected.
  4736	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4737	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile Mr Holohan was entertaining the _Freeman_ man Mrs Kearney was
  4738	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower
  4739	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther voice. The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had
  4740	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecome strained. Mr Bell, the first item, stood ready with his music but
  4741	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe accompanist made no sign. Evidently something was wrong. Mr Kearney
  4742	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked straight before him, stroking his beard, while Mrs Kearney spoke
  4743	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto Kathleen’s ear with subdued emphasis. From the hall came sounds of
  4744	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tencouragement, clapping and stamping of feet. The first tenor and the
  4745	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaritone and Miss Healy stood together, waiting tranquilly, but Mr
  4746	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBell’s nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience
  4747	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould think that he had come late.
  4748	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4749	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan and Mr O’Madden Burke came into the room. In a moment Mr
  4750	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHolohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs Kearney and spoke with
  4751	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew
  4752	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlouder. Mr Holohan became very red and excited. He spoke volubly, but
  4753	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney said curtly at intervals:
  4754	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4755	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She won’t go on. She must get her eight guineas.”
  4756	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4757	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was
  4758	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclapping and stamping. He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But Mr
  4759	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving
  4760	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe point of her new shoe: it was not her fault. Mrs Kearney repeated:
  4761	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4762	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She won’t go on without her money.”
  4763	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4764	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a swift struggle of tongues Mr Holohan hobbled out in haste. The
  4765	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom was silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat
  4766	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpainful Miss Healy said to the baritone:
  4767	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4768	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Have you seen Mrs Pat Campbell this week?”
  4769	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4770	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very
  4771	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfine. The conversation went no further. The first tenor bent his head
  4772	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across
  4773	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the
  4774	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrontal sinus. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs Kearney.
  4775	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4776	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr Fitzpatrick
  4777	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tburst into the room, followed by Mr Holohan, who was panting. The
  4778	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr
  4779	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand. He counted out four
  4780	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto Mrs Kearney’s hand and said she would get the other half at the
  4781	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinterval. Mrs Kearney said:
  4782	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4783	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“This is four shillings short.”
  4784	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4785	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: _“Now, Mr Bell,”_ to
  4786	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the
  4787	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There was a
  4788	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.
  4789	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4790	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam
  4791	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGlynn’s item. The poor lady sang _Killarney_ in a bodiless gasping
  4792	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and
  4793	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing. She
  4794	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the
  4795	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes. The first
  4796	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house. Kathleen
  4797	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplayed a selection of Irish airs which was generously applauded. The
  4798	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by
  4799	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was deservedly
  4800	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapplauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the interval,
  4801	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontent.
  4802	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4803	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one corner
  4804	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere Mr Holohan, Mr Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the
  4805	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaritone, the bass, and Mr O’Madden Burke. Mr O’Madden Burke said it
  4806	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen
  4807	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney’s musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said. The
  4808	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaritone was asked what did he think of Mrs Kearney’s conduct. He did
  4809	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot like to say anything. He had been paid his money and wished to be at
  4810	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeace with men. However, he said that Mrs Kearney might have taken the
  4811	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_artistes_ into consideration. The stewards and the secretaries debated
  4812	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thotly as to what should be done when the interval came.
  4813	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4814	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I agree with Miss Beirne,” said Mr O’Madden Burke. “Pay her nothing.”
  4815	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4816	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn another corner of the room were Mrs Kearney and her husband, Mr Bell,
  4817	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece. Mrs
  4818	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had
  4819	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid.
  4820	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4821	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they
  4822	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their mistake.
  4823	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey wouldn’t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a
  4824	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman. But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn’t
  4825	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe fooled. If they didn’t pay her to the last farthing she would make
  4826	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the _artistes_.
  4827	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut what else could she do? She appealed to the second tenor who said he
  4828	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought she had not been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy.
  4829	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so
  4830	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause she was a great friend of Kathleen’s and the Kearneys had often
  4831	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinvited her to their house.
  4832	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4833	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs soon as the first part was ended Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Holohan went
  4834	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover to Mrs Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be
  4835	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaid after the Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in
  4836	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase her daughter did not play for the second part, the Committee would
  4837	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsider the contract broken and would pay nothing.
  4838	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4839	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I haven’t seen any Committee,” said Mrs Kearney angrily. “My daughter
  4840	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas her contract. She will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot
  4841	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe won’t put on that platform.”
  4842	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4843	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m surprised at you, Mrs Kearney,” said Mr Holohan. “I never thought
  4844	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou would treat us this way.”
  4845	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4846	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what way did you treat me?” asked Mrs Kearney.
  4847	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4848	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she
  4849	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould attack someone with her hands.
  4850	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4851	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m asking for my rights.” she said.
  4852	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4853	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You might have some sense of decency,” said Mr Holohan.
  4854	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4855	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Might I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid
  4856	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI can’t get a civil answer.”
  4857	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4858	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:
  4859	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4860	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You must speak to the secretary. It’s not my business. I’m a great
  4861	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.”
  4862	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4863	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I thought you were a lady,” said Mr Holohan, walking away from her
  4864	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabruptly.
  4865	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4866	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter that Mrs Kearney’s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone
  4867	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapproved of what the Committee had done. She stood at the door, haggard
  4868	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with
  4869	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem. She waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the
  4870	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thope that the secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly
  4871	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsented to play one or two accompaniments. Mrs Kearney had to stand
  4872	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the
  4873	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplatform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image
  4874	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her
  4875	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaughter’s cloak and said to her husband:
  4876	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4877	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Get a cab!”
  4878	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4879	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went out at once. Mrs Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter
  4880	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand followed him. As she passed through the doorway she stopped and
  4881	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglared into Mr Holohan’s face.
  4882	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4883	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m not done with you yet,” she said.
  4884	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4885	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But I’m done with you,” said Mr Holohan.
  4886	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4887	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr Holohan began to pace up and
  4888	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown the room, in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire.
  4889	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4890	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s a nice lady!” he said. “O, she’s a nice lady!”
  4891	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4892	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You did the proper thing, Holohan,” said Mr O’Madden Burke, poised upon
  4893	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this umbrella in approval.
  4894	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4895	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4896	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4897	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGRACE
  4898	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4899	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTWO gentlemen who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him up:
  4900	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut he was quite helpless. He lay curled up at the foot of the stairs
  4901	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown which he had fallen. They succeeded in turning him over. His hat
  4902	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with the filth
  4903	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand ooze of the floor on which he had lain, face downwards. His eyes
  4904	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere closed and he breathed with a grunting noise. A thin stream of
  4905	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblood trickled from the corner of his mouth.
  4906	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4907	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThese two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs
  4908	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand laid him down again on the floor of the bar. In two minutes he was
  4909	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsurrounded by a ring of men. The manager of the bar asked everyone
  4910	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho he was and who was with him. No one knew who he was but one of the
  4911	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum.
  4912	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4913	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Was he by himself?” asked the manager.
  4914	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4915	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, sir. There was two gentlemen with him.”
  4916	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4917	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And where are they?”
  4918	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4919	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo one knew; a voice said:
  4920	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4921	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Give him air. He’s fainted.”
  4922	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4923	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically. A dark
  4924	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmedal of blood had formed itself near the man’s head on the tessellated
  4925	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfloor. The manager, alarmed by the grey pallor of the man’s face, sent
  4926	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a policeman.
  4927	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4928	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis collar was unfastened and his necktie undone. He opened his eyes
  4929	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor an instant, sighed and closed them again. One of gentlemen who had
  4930	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarried him upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand. The manager
  4931	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked repeatedly did no one know who the injured man was or where had
  4932	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this friends gone. The door of the bar opened and an immense constable
  4933	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentered. A crowd which had followed him down the laneway collected
  4934	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutside the door, struggling to look in through the glass panels.
  4935	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4936	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe manager at once began to narrate what he knew. The constable, a
  4937	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung man with thick immobile features, listened. He moved his head
  4938	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on the
  4939	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfloor, as if he feared to be the victim of some delusion. Then he drew
  4940	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff his glove, produced a small book from his waist, licked the lead of
  4941	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this pencil and made ready to indite. He asked in a suspicious provincial
  4942	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccent:
  4943	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4944	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who is the man? What’s his name and address?”
  4945	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4946	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA young man in a cycling-suit cleared his way through the ring of
  4947	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbystanders. He knelt down promptly beside the injured man and called for
  4948	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twater. The constable knelt down also to help. The young man washed the
  4949	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblood from the injured man’s mouth and then called for some brandy. The
  4950	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconstable repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a curate
  4951	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame running with the glass. The brandy was forced down the man’s
  4952	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthroat. In a few seconds he opened his eyes and looked about him. He
  4953	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked at the circle of faces and then, understanding, strove to rise to
  4954	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this feet.
  4955	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4956	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’re all right now?” asked the young man in the cycling-suit.
  4957	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4958	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sha, ‘s nothing,” said the injured man, trying to stand up.
  4959	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4960	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was helped to his feet. The manager said something about a hospital
  4961	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand some of the bystanders gave advice. The battered silk hat was placed
  4962	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the man’s head. The constable asked:
  4963	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4964	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where do you live?”
  4965	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4966	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man, without answering, began to twirl the ends of his moustache.
  4967	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe made light of his accident. It was nothing, he said: only a little
  4968	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccident. He spoke very thickly.
  4969	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4970	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where do you live?” repeated the constable.
  4971	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4972	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man said they were to get a cab for him. While the point was being
  4973	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdebated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a long yellow
  4974	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tulster, came from the far end of the bar. Seeing the spectacle, he
  4975	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalled out:
  4976	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4977	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hallo, Tom, old man! What’s the trouble?”
  4978	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4979	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sha, ‘s nothing,” said the man.
  4980	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4981	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe new-comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then turned
  4982	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the constable, saying:
  4983	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4984	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s all right, constable. I’ll see him home.”
  4985	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4986	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe constable touched his helmet and answered:
  4987	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4988	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All right, Mr Power!”
  4989	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4990	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come now, Tom,” said Mr Power, taking his friend by the arm. “No bones
  4991	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbroken. What? Can you walk?”
  4992	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4993	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe young man in the cycling-suit took the man by the other arm and the
  4994	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrowd divided.
  4995	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4996	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How did you get yourself into this mess?” asked Mr Power.
  4997	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4998	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The gentleman fell down the stairs,” said the young man.
  4999	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5000	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ ‘ery ‘uch o’liged to you, sir,” said the injured man.
  5001	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5002	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not at all.”
  5003	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5004	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘ant we have a little...?”
  5005	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5006	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not now. Not now.”
  5007	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5008	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the doors into
  5009	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe laneway. The manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect
  5010	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe scene of the accident. They agreed that the gentleman must have
  5011	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmissed his footing. The customers returned to the counter and a curate
  5012	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tset about removing the traces of blood from the floor.
  5013	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5014	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen they came out into Grafton Street, Mr Power whistled for an
  5015	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutsider. The injured man said again as well as he could:
  5016	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5017	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ ‘ery ‘uch o’liged to you, sir. I hope we’ll ‘eet again. ‘y na’e is
  5018	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKernan.”
  5019	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5020	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him.
  5021	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5022	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Don’t mention it,” said the young man.
  5023	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5024	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey shook hands. Mr Kernan was hoisted on to the car and, while Mr
  5025	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPower was giving directions to the carman, he expressed his gratitude
  5026	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the young man and regretted that they could not have a little drink
  5027	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether.
  5028	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5029	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Another time,” said the young man.
  5030	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5031	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe car drove off towards Westmoreland Street. As it passed Ballast
  5032	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOffice the clock showed half-past nine. A keen east wind hit them,
  5033	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblowing from the mouth of the river. Mr Kernan was huddled together with
  5034	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcold. His friend asked him to tell how the accident had happened.
  5035	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5036	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I ‘an’t, ‘an,” he answered, “‘y ‘ongue is hurt.”
  5037	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5038	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Show.”
  5039	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5040	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe other leaned over the well of the car and peered into Mr Kernan’s
  5041	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouth but he could not see. He struck a match and, sheltering it in the
  5042	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshell of his hands, peered again into the mouth which Mr Kernan opened
  5043	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobediently. The swaying movement of the car brought the match to and
  5044	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the opened mouth. The lower teeth and gums were covered with
  5045	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclotted blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been
  5046	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbitten off. The match was blown out.
  5047	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5048	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s ugly,” said Mr Power.
  5049	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5050	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sha, ‘s nothing,” said Mr Kernan, closing his mouth and pulling the
  5051	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollar of his filthy coat across his neck.
  5052	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5053	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in
  5054	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dignity of its calling. He had never been seen in the city without
  5055	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters. By grace of these
  5056	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo articles of clothing, he said, a man could always pass muster. He
  5057	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarried on the tradition of his Napoleon, the great Blackwhite, whose
  5058	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmemory he evoked at times by legend and mimicry. Modern business methods
  5059	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in Crowe
  5060	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStreet on the window blind of which was written the name of his firm
  5061	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the address--London, E.C. On the mantelpiece of this little office
  5062	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table
  5063	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half
  5064	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of a black liquid. From these bowls Mr Kernan tasted tea. He took
  5065	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta mouthful, drew it up, saturated his palate with it and then spat it
  5066	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforth into the grate. Then he paused to judge.
  5067	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5068	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power, a much younger man, was employed in the Royal Irish
  5069	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConstabulary Office in Dublin Castle. The arc of his social rise
  5070	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintersected the arc of his friend’s decline, but Mr Kernan’s decline was
  5071	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who had known him at
  5072	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this highest point of success still esteemed him as a character. Mr Power
  5073	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas one of these friends. His inexplicable debts were a byword in his
  5074	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcircle; he was a debonair young man.
  5075	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5076	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe car halted before a small house on the Glasnevin road and Mr Kernan
  5077	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas helped into the house. His wife put him to bed while Mr Power sat
  5078	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdownstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school
  5079	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand what book they were in. The children--two girls and a boy, conscious
  5080	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof their father’s helplessness and of their mother’s absence, began
  5081	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome horseplay with him. He was surprised at their manners and at their
  5082	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccents, and his brow grew thoughtful. After a while Mrs Kernan entered
  5083	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe kitchen, exclaiming:
  5084	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5085	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Such a sight! O, he’ll do for himself one day and that’s the holy alls
  5086	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof it. He’s been drinking since Friday.”
  5087	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5088	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible, that
  5089	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had come on the scene by the merest accident. Mrs Kernan, remembering
  5090	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power’s good offices during domestic quarrels, as well as many small,
  5091	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut opportune loans, said:
  5092	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5093	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, you needn’t tell me that, Mr Power. I know you’re a friend of his,
  5094	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot like some of the others he does be with. They’re all right so long
  5095	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and family.
  5096	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNice friends! Who was he with tonight, I’d like to know?”
  5097	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5098	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power shook his head but said nothing.
  5099	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5100	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m so sorry,” she continued, “that I’ve nothing in the house to
  5101	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffer you. But if you wait a minute I’ll send round to Fogarty’s at the
  5102	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorner.”
  5103	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5104	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power stood up.
  5105	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5106	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We were waiting for him to come home with the money. He never seems to
  5107	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthink he has a home at all.”
  5108	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5109	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, now, Mrs Kernan,” said Mr Power, “we’ll make him turn over a new
  5110	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaf. I’ll talk to Martin. He’s the man. We’ll come here one of these
  5111	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnights and talk it over.”
  5112	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5113	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe saw him to the door. The carman was stamping up and down the
  5114	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfootpath, and swinging his arms to warm himself.
  5115	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5116	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s very kind of you to bring him home,” she said.
  5117	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5118	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not at all,” said Mr Power.
  5119	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5120	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe got up on the car. As it drove off he raised his hat to her gaily.
  5121	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5122	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We’ll make a new man of him,” he said. “Good-night, Mrs Kernan.”
  5123	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5124	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5125	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5126	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan’s puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of sight.
  5127	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen she withdrew them, went into the house and emptied her husband’s
  5128	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpockets.
  5129	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5130	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was an active, practical woman of middle age. Not long before she
  5131	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her intimacy with her
  5132	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thusband by waltzing with him to Mr Power’s accompaniment. In her days
  5133	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof courtship Mr Kernan had seemed to her a not ungallant figure: and she
  5134	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and,
  5135	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseeing the bridal pair, recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed
  5136	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the Star of the Sea Church in Sandymount, leaning on the arm of
  5137	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta jovial well-fed man, who was dressed smartly in a frock-coat and
  5138	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlavender trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon his
  5139	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother arm. After three weeks she had found a wife’s life irksome and,
  5140	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlater on, when she was beginning to find it unbearable, she had become a
  5141	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmother. The part of mother presented to her no insuperable difficulties
  5142	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand for twenty-five years she had kept house shrewdly for her husband.
  5143	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer two eldest sons were launched. One was in a draper’s shop in Glasgow
  5144	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the other was clerk to a tea-merchant in Belfast. They were good
  5145	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsons, wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money. The other children
  5146	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere still at school.
  5147	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5148	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed. She
  5149	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade beef-tea for him and scolded him roundly. She accepted his frequent
  5150	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintemperance as part of the climate, healed him dutifully whenever he
  5151	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sick and always tried to make him eat a breakfast. There were worse
  5152	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thusbands. He had never been violent since the boys had grown up and she
  5153	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew that he would walk to the end of Thomas Street and back again to
  5154	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbook even a small order.
  5155	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5156	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo nights after his friends came to see him. She brought them up to
  5157	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this bedroom, the air of which was impregnated with a personal odour,
  5158	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand gave them chairs at the fire. Mr Kernan’s tongue, the occasional
  5159	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstinging pain of which had made him somewhat irritable during the day,
  5160	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecame more polite. He sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the
  5161	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle colour in his puffy cheeks made them resemble warm cinders. He
  5162	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapologised to his guests for the disorder of the room, but at the same
  5163	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime looked at them a little proudly, with a veteran’s pride.
  5164	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5165	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his
  5166	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriends, Mr Cunningham, Mr M’Coy and Mr Power had disclosed to Mrs
  5167	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKernan in the parlour. The idea had been Mr Power’s but its development
  5168	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas entrusted to Mr Cunningham. Mr Kernan came of Protestant stock and,
  5169	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough he had been converted to the Catholic faith at the time of his
  5170	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarriage, he had not been in the pale of the Church for twenty years. He
  5171	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas fond, moreover, of giving side-thrusts at Catholicism.
  5172	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5173	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham was the very man for such a case. He was an elder
  5174	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcolleague of Mr Power. His own domestic life was not very happy. People
  5175	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad great sympathy with him for it was known that he had married an
  5176	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard. He had set up house
  5177	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her six times; and each time she had pawned the furniture on him.
  5178	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5179	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham. He was a thoroughly
  5180	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsensible man, influential and intelligent. His blade of human knowledge,
  5181	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnatural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the
  5182	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpolice courts, had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters
  5183	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof general philosophy. He was well informed. His friends bowed to his
  5184	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topinions and considered that his face was like Shakespeare’s.
  5185	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5186	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the plot had been disclosed to her, Mrs Kernan had said:
  5187	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5188	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I leave it all in your hands, Mr Cunningham.”
  5189	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5190	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a quarter of a century of married life, she had very few illusions
  5191	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleft. Religion for her was a habit and she suspected that a man of her
  5192	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thusband’s age would not change greatly before death. She was tempted to
  5193	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee a curious appropriateness in his accident and, but that she did not
  5194	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twish to seem bloody-minded, she would have told the gentlemen that
  5195	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan’s tongue would not suffer by being shortened. However, Mr
  5196	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCunningham was a capable man; and religion was religion. The scheme
  5197	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmight do good and, at least, it could do no harm. Her beliefs were
  5198	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot extravagant. She believed steadily in the Sacred Heart as the
  5199	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmost generally useful of all Catholic devotions and approved of the
  5200	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsacraments. Her faith was bounded by her kitchen but, if she was put to
  5201	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit, she could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost.
  5202	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5203	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe gentlemen began to talk of the accident. Mr Cunningham said that he
  5204	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad once known a similar case. A man of seventy had bitten off a piece
  5205	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again
  5206	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso that no one could see a trace of the bite.
  5207	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5208	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I’m not seventy,” said the invalid.
  5209	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5210	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God forbid,” said Mr Cunningham.
  5211	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5212	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It doesn’t pain you now?” asked Mr M’Coy.
  5213	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5214	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr M’Coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation. His wife, who
  5215	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been a soprano, still taught young children to play the piano at low
  5216	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterms. His line of life had not been the shortest distance between two
  5217	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoints and for short periods he had been driven to live by his wits. He
  5218	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been a clerk in the Midland Railway, a canvasser for advertisements
  5219	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor _The Irish Times_ and for _The Freeman’s Journal_, a town traveller
  5220	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a coal firm on commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk in the
  5221	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffice of the Sub-Sheriff and he had recently become secretary to the
  5222	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCity Coroner. His new office made him professionally interested in Mr
  5223	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKernan’s case.
  5224	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5225	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Pain? Not much,” answered Mr Kernan. “But it’s so sickening. I feel as
  5226	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif I wanted to retch off.”
  5227	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5228	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s the boose,” said Mr Cunningham firmly.
  5229	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5230	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” said Mr Kernan. “I think I caught a cold on the car. There’s
  5231	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething keeps coming into my throat, phlegm or----”
  5232	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5233	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mucus.” said Mr M’Coy.
  5234	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5235	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It keeps coming like from down in my throat; sickening thing.”
  5236	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5237	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, yes,” said Mr M’Coy, “that’s the thorax.”
  5238	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5239	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked at Mr Cunningham and Mr Power at the same time with an air of
  5240	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchallenge. Mr Cunningham nodded his head rapidly and Mr Power said:
  5241	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5242	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well, all’s well that ends well.”
  5243	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5244	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m very much obliged to you, old man,” said the invalid.
  5245	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5246	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power waved his hand.
  5247	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5248	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Those other two fellows I was with----”
  5249	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5250	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who were you with?” asked Mr Cunningham.
  5251	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5252	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A chap. I don’t know his name. Damn it now, what’s his name? Little
  5253	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchap with sandy hair....”
  5254	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5255	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And who else?”
  5256	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5257	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Harford.”
  5258	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5259	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hm,” said Mr Cunningham.
  5260	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5261	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen Mr Cunningham made that remark, people were silent. It was known
  5262	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat the speaker had secret sources of information. In this case the
  5263	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmonosyllable had a moral intention. Mr Harford sometimes formed one of a
  5264	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle detachment which left the city shortly after noon on Sunday with
  5265	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some public-house on the
  5266	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutskirts of the city where its members duly qualified themselves as
  5267	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_bona fide_ travellers. But his fellow-travellers had never consented
  5268	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto overlook his origin. He had begun life as an obscure financier by
  5269	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlending small sums of money to workmen at usurious interest. Later on
  5270	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had become the partner of a very fat short gentleman, Mr Goldberg, in
  5271	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Liffey Loan Bank. Though he had never embraced more than the Jewish
  5272	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tethical code his fellow-Catholics, whenever they had smarted in person
  5273	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor by proxy under his exactions, spoke of him bitterly as an Irish Jew
  5274	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand an illiterate and saw divine disapproval of usury made manifest
  5275	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the person of his idiot son. At other times they remembered his
  5276	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood points.
  5277	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5278	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wonder where did he go to,” said Mr Kernan.
  5279	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5280	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe wished the details of the incident to remain vague. He wished his
  5281	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriends to think there had been some mistake, that Mr Harford and he had
  5282	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmissed each other. His friends, who knew quite well Mr Harford’s manners
  5283	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin drinking, were silent. Mr Power said again:
  5284	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5285	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All’s well that ends well.”
  5286	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5287	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan changed the subject at once.
  5288	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5289	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That was a decent young chap, that medical fellow,” he said. “Only for
  5290	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim----”
  5291	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5292	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, only for him,” said Mr Power, “it might have been a case of seven
  5293	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays, without the option of a fine.”
  5294	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5295	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, yes,” said Mr Kernan, trying to remember. “I remember now there
  5296	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a policeman. Decent young fellow, he seemed. How did it happen at
  5297	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall?”
  5298	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5299	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It happened that you were peloothered, Tom,” said Mr Cunningham
  5300	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgravely.
  5301	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5302	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“True bill,” said Mr Kernan, equally gravely.
  5303	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5304	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I suppose you squared the constable, Jack,” said Mr M’Coy.
  5305	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5306	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power did not relish the use of his Christian name. He was not
  5307	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstraight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr M’Coy had recently made
  5308	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs M’Coy to
  5309	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfulfil imaginary engagements in the country. More than he resented the
  5310	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the
  5311	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgame. He answered the question, therefore, as if Mr Kernan had asked it.
  5312	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5313	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe narrative made Mr Kernan indignant. He was keenly conscious of his
  5314	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcitizenship, wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable
  5315	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country
  5316	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbumpkins.
  5317	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5318	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is this what we pay rates for?” he asked. “To feed and clothe these
  5319	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tignorant bostooms ... and they’re nothing else.”
  5320	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5321	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham laughed. He was a Castle official only during office
  5322	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thours.
  5323	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5324	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How could they be anything else, Tom?” he said.
  5325	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5326	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command:
  5327	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5328	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“65, catch your cabbage!”
  5329	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5330	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone laughed. Mr M’Coy, who wanted to enter the conversation by any
  5331	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor, pretended that he had never heard the story. Mr Cunningham said:
  5332	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5333	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It is supposed--they say, you know--to take place in the depot where
  5334	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey get these thundering big country fellows, omadhauns, you know, to
  5335	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrill. The sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold
  5336	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup their plates.”
  5337	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5338	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe illustrated the story by grotesque gestures.
  5339	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5340	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“At dinner, you know. Then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before
  5341	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel. He takes up a wad
  5342	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils
  5343	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave to try and catch it on their plates: 65, _catch your cabbage_.”
  5344	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5345	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone laughed again: but Mr Kernan was somewhat indignant still. He
  5346	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalked of writing a letter to the papers.
  5347	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5348	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“These yahoos coming up here,” he said, “think they can boss the people.
  5349	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI needn’t tell you, Martin, what kind of men they are.”
  5350	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5351	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham gave a qualified assent.
  5352	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5353	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s like everything else in this world,” he said. “You get some bad
  5354	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tones and you get some good ones.”
  5355	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5356	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O yes, you get some good ones, I admit,” said Mr Kernan, satisfied.
  5357	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5358	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s better to have nothing to say to them,” said Mr M’Coy. “That’s my
  5359	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topinion!”
  5360	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5361	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan entered the room and, placing a tray on the table, said:
  5362	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5363	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Help yourselves, gentlemen.”
  5364	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5365	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power stood up to officiate, offering her his chair. She declined
  5366	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit, saying she was ironing downstairs, and, after having exchanged a nod
  5367	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Mr Cunningham behind Mr Power’s back, prepared to leave the room.
  5368	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer husband called out to her:
  5369	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5370	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And have you nothing for me, duckie?”
  5371	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5372	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, you! The back of my hand to you!” said Mrs Kernan tartly.
  5373	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5374	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer husband called after her:
  5375	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5376	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Nothing for poor little hubby!”
  5377	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5378	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the
  5379	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottles of stout took place amid general merriment.
  5380	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5381	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe gentlemen drank from their glasses, set the glasses again on the
  5382	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable and paused. Then Mr Cunningham turned towards Mr Power and said
  5383	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcasually:
  5384	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5385	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“On Thursday night, you said, Jack.”
  5386	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5387	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thursday, yes,” said Mr Power.
  5388	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5389	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Righto!” said Mr Cunningham promptly.
  5390	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5391	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We can meet in M’Auley’s,” said Mr M’Coy. “That’ll be the most
  5392	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconvenient place.”
  5393	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5394	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But we mustn’t be late,” said Mr Power earnestly, “because it is sure
  5395	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be crammed to the doors.”
  5396	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5397	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We can meet at half-seven,” said Mr M’Coy.
  5398	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5399	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Righto!” said Mr Cunningham.
  5400	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5401	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Half-seven at M’Auley’s be it!”
  5402	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5403	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a short silence. Mr Kernan waited to see whether he would be
  5404	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaken into his friends’ confidence. Then he asked:
  5405	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5406	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What’s in the wind?”
  5407	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5408	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, it’s nothing,” said Mr Cunningham. “It’s only a little matter that
  5409	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe’re arranging about for Thursday.”
  5410	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5411	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The opera, is it?” said Mr Kernan.
  5412	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5413	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no,” said Mr Cunningham in an evasive tone, “it’s just a little ...
  5414	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspiritual matter.”
  5415	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5416	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O,” said Mr Kernan.
  5417	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5418	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was silence again. Then Mr Power said, point blank:
  5419	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5420	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To tell you the truth, Tom, we’re going to make a retreat.”
  5421	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5422	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, that’s it,” said Mr Cunningham, “Jack and I and M’Coy here--we’re
  5423	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall going to wash the pot.”
  5424	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5425	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and, encouraged by
  5426	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this own voice, proceeded:
  5427	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5428	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You see, we may as well all admit we’re a nice collection of
  5429	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscoundrels, one and all. I say, one and all,” he added with gruff
  5430	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharity and turning to Mr Power. “Own up now!”
  5431	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5432	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I own up,” said Mr Power.
  5433	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5434	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And I own up,” said Mr M’Coy.
  5435	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5436	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So we’re going to wash the pot together,” said Mr Cunningham.
  5437	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5438	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA thought seemed to strike him. He turned suddenly to the invalid and
  5439	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
  5440	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5441	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“D’ye know what, Tom, has just occurred to me? You night join in and
  5442	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe’d have a four-handed reel.”
  5443	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5444	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good idea,” said Mr Power. “The four of us together.”
  5445	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5446	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan was silent. The proposal conveyed very little meaning to
  5447	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this mind but, understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to
  5448	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcern themselves on his behalf, he thought he owed it to his dignity
  5449	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto show a stiff neck. He took no part in the conversation for a long
  5450	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile but listened, with an air of calm enmity, while his friends
  5451	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscussed the Jesuits.
  5452	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5453	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I haven’t such a bad opinion of the Jesuits,” he said, intervening at
  5454	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlength. “They’re an educated order. I believe they mean well too.”
  5455	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5456	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They’re the grandest order in the Church, Tom,” said Mr Cunningham,
  5457	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith enthusiasm. “The General of the Jesuits stands next to the Pope.”
  5458	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5459	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s no mistake about it,” said Mr M’Coy, “if you want a thing well
  5460	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdone and no flies about it you go to a Jesuit. They’re the boyos have
  5461	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfluence. I’ll tell you a case in point....”
  5462	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5463	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Jesuits are a fine body of men,” said Mr Power.
  5464	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5465	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s a curious thing,” said Mr Cunningham, “about the Jesuit Order.
  5466	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery other order of the Church had to be reformed at some time or other
  5467	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut the Jesuit Order was never once reformed. It never fell away.”
  5468	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5469	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that so?” asked Mr M’Coy.
  5470	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5471	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s a fact,” said Mr Cunningham. “That’s history.”
  5472	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5473	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Look at their church, too,” said Mr Power. “Look at the congregation
  5474	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey have.”
  5475	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5476	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Jesuits cater for the upper classes,” said Mr M’Coy.
  5477	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5478	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course,” said Mr Power.
  5479	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5480	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Kernan. “That’s why I have a feeling for them. It’s some
  5481	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof those secular priests, ignorant, bumptious----”
  5482	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5483	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They’re all good men,” said Mr Cunningham, “each in his own way. The
  5484	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIrish priesthood is honoured all the world over.”
  5485	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5486	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O yes,” said Mr Power.
  5487	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5488	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent,” said Mr
  5489	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM’Coy, “unworthy of the name.”
  5490	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5491	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Perhaps you’re right,” said Mr Kernan, relenting.
  5492	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5493	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course I’m right,” said Mr Cunningham. “I haven’t been in the
  5494	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld all this time and seen most sides of it without being a judge of
  5495	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharacter.”
  5496	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5497	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe gentlemen drank again, one following another’s example. Mr Kernan
  5498	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to be weighing something in his mind. He was impressed. He had a
  5499	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh opinion of Mr Cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of
  5500	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaces. He asked for particulars.
  5501	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5502	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, it’s just a retreat, you know,” said Mr Cunningham. “Father Purdon
  5503	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis giving it. It’s for business men, you know.”
  5504	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5505	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He won’t be too hard on us, Tom,” said Mr Power persuasively.
  5506	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5507	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Father Purdon? Father Purdon?” said the invalid.
  5508	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5509	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, you must know him, Tom,” said Mr Cunningham stoutly. “Fine jolly
  5510	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow! He’s a man of the world like ourselves.”
  5511	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5512	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, ... yes. I think I know him. Rather red face; tall.”
  5513	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5514	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s the man.”
  5515	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5516	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And tell me, Martin.... Is he a good preacher?”
  5517	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5518	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Munno.... It’s not exactly a sermon, you know. It’s just kind of a
  5519	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriendly talk, you know, in a common-sense way.”
  5520	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5521	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan deliberated. Mr M’Coy said:
  5522	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5523	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Father Tom Burke, that was the boy!”
  5524	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5525	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Father Tom Burke,” said Mr Cunningham, “that was a born orator. Did
  5526	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou ever hear him, Tom?”
  5527	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5528	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did I ever hear him!” said the invalid, nettled. “Rather! I heard
  5529	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim....”
  5530	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5531	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And yet they say he wasn’t much of a theologian,” said Mr Cunningham.
  5532	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5533	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that so?” said Mr M’Coy.
  5534	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5535	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, of course, nothing wrong, you know. Only sometimes, they say, he
  5536	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdidn’t preach what was quite orthodox.”
  5537	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5538	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah! ... he was a splendid man,” said Mr M’Coy.
  5539	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5540	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I heard him once,” Mr Kernan continued. “I forget the subject of his
  5541	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscourse now. Crofton and I were in the back of the ... pit, you know
  5542	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t... the----”
  5543	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5544	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The body,” said Mr Cunningham.
  5545	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5546	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, in the back near the door. I forget now what.... O yes, it was
  5547	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the Pope, the late Pope. I remember it well. Upon my word it was
  5548	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmagnificent, the style of the oratory. And his voice! God! hadn’t he a
  5549	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice! _The Prisoner of the Vatican_, he called him. I remember Crofton
  5550	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaying to me when we came out----”
  5551	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5552	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But he’s an Orangeman, Crofton, isn’t he?” said Mr Power.
  5553	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5554	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘Course he is,” said Mr Kernan, “and a damned decent Orangeman too. We
  5555	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twent into Butler’s in Moore Street--faith, I was genuinely moved, tell
  5556	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou the God’s truth--and I remember well his very words. _Kernan_, he
  5557	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid, _we worship at different altars_, he said, _but our belief is the
  5558	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame_. Struck me as very well put.”
  5559	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5560	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s a good deal in that,” said Mr Power. “There used always to be
  5561	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrowds of Protestants in the chapel where Father Tom was preaching.”
  5562	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5563	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s not much difference between us,” said Mr M’Coy.
  5564	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5565	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We both believe in----”
  5566	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5567	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe hesitated for a moment.
  5568	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5569	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“... in the Redeemer. Only they don’t believe in the Pope and in the
  5570	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmother of God.”
  5571	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5572	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But, of course,” said Mr Cunningham quietly and effectively, “our
  5573	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treligion is _the_ religion, the old, original faith.”
  5574	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5575	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not a doubt of it,” said Mr Kernan warmly.
  5576	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5577	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced:
  5578	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5579	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here’s a visitor for you!”
  5580	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5581	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who is it?”
  5582	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5583	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Fogarty.”
  5584	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5585	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, come in! come in!”
  5586	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5587	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA pale oval face came forward into the light. The arch of its fair
  5588	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above
  5589	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasantly astonished eyes. Mr Fogarty was a modest grocer. He had
  5590	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailed in business in a licensed house in the city because his financial
  5591	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcondition had constrained him to tie himself to second-class distillers
  5592	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand brewers. He had opened a small shop on Glasnevin Road where, he
  5593	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflattered himself, his manners would ingratiate him with the housewives
  5594	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the district. He bore himself with a certain grace, complimented
  5595	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle children and spoke with a neat enunciation. He was not without
  5596	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tculture.
  5597	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5598	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Fogarty brought a gift with him, a half-pint of special whisky. He
  5599	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinquired politely for Mr Kernan, placed his gift on the table and sat
  5600	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown with the company on equal terms. Mr Kernan appreciated the gift all
  5601	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe more since he was aware that there was a small account for groceries
  5602	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunsettled between him and Mr Fogarty. He said:
  5603	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5604	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wouldn’t doubt you, old man. Open that, Jack, will you?”
  5605	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5606	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power again officiated. Glasses were rinsed and five small
  5607	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeasures of whisky were poured out. This new influence enlivened the
  5608	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconversation. Mr Fogarty, sitting on a small area of the chair, was
  5609	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspecially interested.
  5610	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5611	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Pope Leo XIII.,” said Mr Cunningham, “was one of the lights of the age.
  5612	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis great idea, you know, was the union of the Latin and Greek Churches.
  5613	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat was the aim of his life.”
  5614	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5615	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in Europe,” said
  5616	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power. “I mean, apart from his being Pope.”
  5617	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5618	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So he was,” said Mr Cunningham, “if not _the_ most so. His motto, you
  5619	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow, as Pope, was _Lux upon Lux--Light upon Light_.”
  5620	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5621	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no,” said Mr Fogarty eagerly. “I think you’re wrong there. It was
  5622	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Lux in Tenebris_, I think--_Light in Darkness_.”
  5623	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5624	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O yes,” said Mr M’Coy, “_Tenebrae_.”
  5625	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5626	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Allow me,” said Mr Cunningham positively, “it was _Lux upon Lux_. And
  5627	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPius IX. his predecessor’s motto was _Crux upon Crux_--that is, _Cross
  5628	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon Cross_--to show the difference between their two pontificates.”
  5629	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5630	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe inference was allowed. Mr Cunningham continued.
  5631	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5632	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Pope Leo, you know, was a great scholar and a poet.”
  5633	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5634	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He had a strong face,” said Mr Kernan.
  5635	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5636	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Cunningham. “He wrote Latin poetry.”
  5637	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5638	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that so?” said Mr Fogarty.
  5639	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5640	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr M’Coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double
  5641	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintention, saying:
  5642	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5643	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s no joke, I can tell you.”
  5644	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5645	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We didn’t learn that, Tom,” said Mr Power, following Mr M’Coy’s
  5646	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texample, “when we went to the penny-a-week school.”
  5647	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5648	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There was many a good man went to the penny-a-week school with a sod of
  5649	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturf under his oxter,” said Mr Kernan sententiously. “The old system was
  5650	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe best: plain honest education. None of your modern trumpery....”
  5651	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5652	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Quite right,” said Mr Power.
  5653	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5654	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No superfluities,” said Mr Fogarty.
  5655	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5656	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe enunciated the word and then drank gravely.
  5657	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5658	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I remember reading,” said Mr Cunningham, “that one of Pope Leo’s poems
  5659	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas on the invention of the photograph--in Latin, of course.”
  5660	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5661	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“On the photograph!” exclaimed Mr Kernan.
  5662	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5663	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Cunningham.
  5664	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5665	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe also drank from his glass.
  5666	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5667	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, you know,” said Mr M’Coy, “isn’t the photograph wonderful when
  5668	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou come to think of it?”
  5669	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5670	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, of course,” said Mr Power, “great minds can see things.”
  5671	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5672	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“As the poet says: _Great minds are very near to madness_,” said Mr
  5673	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFogarty.
  5674	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5675	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan seemed to be troubled in mind. He made an effort to recall the
  5676	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProtestant theology on some thorny points and in the end addressed Mr
  5677	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCunningham.
  5678	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5679	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me, Martin,” he said. “Weren’t some of the popes--of course, not
  5680	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour present man, or his predecessor, but some of the old popes--not
  5681	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texactly ... you know ... up to the knocker?”
  5682	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5683	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a silence. Mr Cunningham said
  5684	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5685	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, of course, there were some bad lots.... But the astonishing thing
  5686	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis this. Not one of them, not the biggest drunkard, not the most ...
  5687	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout-and-out ruffian, not one of them ever preached _ex cathedra_ a word
  5688	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof false doctrine. Now isn’t that an astonishing thing?”
  5689	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5690	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That is,” said Mr Kernan.
  5691	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5692	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, because when the Pope speaks _ex cathedra_,” Mr Fogarty explained,
  5693	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“he is infallible.”
  5694	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5695	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Cunningham.
  5696	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5697	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I know about the infallibility of the Pope. I remember I was younger
  5698	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen.... Or was it that----?”
  5699	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5700	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Fogarty interrupted. He took up the bottle and helped the others to
  5701	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta little more. Mr M’Coy, seeing that there was not enough to go round,
  5702	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleaded that he had not finished his first measure. The others accepted
  5703	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder protest. The light music of whisky falling into glasses made an
  5704	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagreeable interlude.
  5705	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5706	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What’s that you were saying, Tom?” asked Mr M’Coy.
  5707	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5708	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Papal infallibility,” said Mr Cunningham, “that was the greatest scene
  5709	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the whole history of the Church.”
  5710	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5711	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How was that, Martin?” asked Mr Power.
  5712	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5713	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham held up two thick fingers.
  5714	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5715	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“In the sacred college, you know, of cardinals and archbishops and
  5716	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbishops there were two men who held out against it while the others were
  5717	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall for it. The whole conclave except these two was unanimous. No! They
  5718	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldn’t have it!”
  5719	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5720	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ha!” said Mr M’Coy.
  5721	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5722	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And they were a German cardinal by the name of Dolling ... or Dowling
  5723	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t... or----”
  5724	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5725	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Dowling was no German, and that’s a sure five,” said Mr Power,
  5726	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing.
  5727	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5728	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, this great German cardinal, whatever his name was, was one; and
  5729	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other was John MacHale.”
  5730	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5731	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What?” cried Mr Kernan. “Is it John of Tuam?”
  5732	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5733	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you sure of that now?” asked Mr Fogarty dubiously. “I thought it
  5734	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas some Italian or American.”
  5735	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5736	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“John of Tuam,” repeated Mr Cunningham, “was the man.”
  5737	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5738	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drank and the other gentlemen followed his lead. Then he resumed:
  5739	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5740	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There they were at it, all the cardinals and bishops and archbishops
  5741	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom all the ends of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil
  5742	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuntil at last the Pope himself stood up and declared infallibility a
  5743	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdogma of the Church _ex cathedra_. On the very moment John MacHale, who
  5744	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been arguing and arguing against it, stood up and shouted out with
  5745	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe voice of a lion: ‘_Credo!_’”
  5746	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5747	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_I believe!_” said Mr Fogarty.
  5748	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5749	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_Credo!_” said Mr Cunningham. “That showed the faith he had. He
  5750	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubmitted the moment the Pope spoke.”
  5751	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5752	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what about Dowling?” asked Mr M’Coy.
  5753	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5754	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The German cardinal wouldn’t submit. He left the church.”
  5755	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5756	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham’s words had built up the vast image of the church in the
  5757	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminds of his hearers. His deep raucous voice had thrilled them as it
  5758	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuttered the word of belief and submission. When Mrs Kernan came into
  5759	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe room drying her hands she came into a solemn company. She did not
  5760	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisturb the silence, but leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed.
  5761	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5762	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I once saw John MacHale,” said Mr Kernan, “and I’ll never forget it as
  5763	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong as I live.”
  5764	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5765	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned towards his wife to be confirmed.
  5766	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5767	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I often told you that?”
  5768	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5769	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan nodded.
  5770	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5771	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray’s statue. Edmund Dwyer
  5772	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGray was speaking, blathering away, and here was this old fellow,
  5773	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrabbed-looking old chap, looking at him from under his bushy eyebrows.”
  5774	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5775	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan knitted his brows and, lowering his head like an angry bull,
  5776	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglared at his wife.
  5777	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5778	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God!” he exclaimed, resuming his natural face, “I never saw such an eye
  5779	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a man’s head. It was as much as to say: _I have you properly taped,
  5780	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy lad_. He had an eye like a hawk.”
  5781	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5782	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“None of the Grays was any good,” said Mr Power.
  5783	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5784	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a pause again. Mr Power turned to Mrs Kernan and said with
  5785	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabrupt joviality:
  5786	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5787	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Mrs Kernan, we’re going to make your man here a good holy pious
  5788	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand God-fearing Roman Catholic.”
  5789	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5790	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe swept his arm round the company inclusively.
  5791	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5792	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We’re all going to make a retreat together and confess our sins--and
  5793	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod knows we want it badly.”
  5794	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5795	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t mind,” said Mr Kernan, smiling a little nervously.
  5796	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5797	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction. So she
  5798	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
  5799	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5800	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale.”
  5801	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5802	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan’s expression changed.
  5803	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5804	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If he doesn’t like it,” he said bluntly, “he can ... do the other
  5805	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing. I’ll just tell him my little tale of woe. I’m not such a bad
  5806	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow----”
  5807	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5808	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham intervened promptly.
  5809	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5810	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We’ll all renounce the devil,” he said, “together, not forgetting his
  5811	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworks and pomps.”
  5812	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5813	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Get behind me, Satan!” said Mr Fogarty, laughing and looking at the
  5814	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers.
  5815	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5816	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power said nothing. He felt completely out-generalled. But a pleased
  5817	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpression flickered across his face.
  5818	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5819	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All we have to do,” said Mr Cunningham, “is to stand up with lighted
  5820	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows.”
  5821	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5822	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, don’t forget the candle, Tom,” said Mr M’Coy, “whatever you do.”
  5823	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5824	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What?” said Mr Kernan. “Must I have a candle?”
  5825	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5826	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O yes,” said Mr Cunningham.
  5827	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5828	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, damn it all,” said Mr Kernan sensibly, “I draw the line there. I’ll
  5829	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo the job right enough. I’ll do the retreat business and confession,
  5830	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand ... all that business. But ... no candles! No, damn it all, I bar
  5831	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe candles!”
  5832	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5833	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe shook his head with farcical gravity.
  5834	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5835	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Listen to that!” said his wife.
  5836	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5837	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I bar the candles,” said Mr Kernan, conscious of having created an
  5838	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teffect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and fro. “I
  5839	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbar the magic-lantern business.”
  5840	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5841	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone laughed heartily.
  5842	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5843	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s a nice Catholic for you!” said his wife.
  5844	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5845	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No candles!” repeated Mr Kernan obdurately. “That’s off!”
  5846	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5847	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5848	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5849	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe transept of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street was almost full;
  5850	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand still at every moment gentlemen entered from the side door and,
  5851	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirected by the lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the aisles until
  5852	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey found seating accommodation. The gentlemen were all well dressed
  5853	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand orderly. The light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly
  5854	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof black clothes and white collars, relieved here and there by tweeds,
  5855	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases. The
  5856	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentlemen sat in the benches, having hitched their trousers slightly
  5857	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabove their knees and laid their hats in security. They sat well back
  5858	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended
  5859	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore the high altar.
  5860	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5861	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn one of the benches near the pulpit sat Mr Cunningham and Mr Kernan.
  5862	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the bench behind sat Mr M’Coy alone: and in the bench behind him sat
  5863	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power and Mr Fogarty. Mr M’Coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a
  5864	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace in the bench with the others and, when the party had settled down
  5865	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the form of a quincunx, he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic
  5866	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremarks. As these had not been well received he had desisted. Even he
  5867	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond
  5868	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the religious stimulus. In a whisper Mr Cunningham drew Mr Kernan’s
  5869	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattention to Mr Harford, the moneylender, who sat some distance off, and
  5870	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Mr Fanning, the registration agent and mayor maker of the city, who
  5871	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected
  5872	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouncillors of the ward. To the right sat old Michael Grimes, the owner
  5873	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof three pawnbroker’s shops, and Dan Hogan’s nephew, who was up for the
  5874	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjob in the Town Clerk’s office. Farther in front sat Mr Hendrick, the
  5875	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchief reporter of _The Freeman’s Journal_, and poor O’Carroll, an
  5876	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told friend of Mr Kernan’s, who had been at one time a considerable
  5877	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommercial figure. Gradually, as he recognised familiar faces, Mr Kernan
  5878	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to feel more at home. His hat, which had been rehabilitated by his
  5879	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twife, rested upon his knees. Once or twice he pulled down his cuffs with
  5880	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone hand while he held the brim of his hat lightly, but firmly, with the
  5881	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother hand.
  5882	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5883	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA powerful-looking figure, the upper part of which was draped with
  5884	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta white surplice, was observed to be struggling into the pulpit.
  5885	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSimultaneously the congregation unsettled, produced handkerchiefs and
  5886	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknelt upon them with care. Mr Kernan followed the general example. The
  5887	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpriest’s figure now stood upright in the pulpit, two-thirds of its bulk,
  5888	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrowned by a massive red face, appearing above the balustrade.
  5889	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5890	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Purdon knelt down, turned towards the red speck of light
  5891	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, covering his face with his hands, prayed. After an interval, he
  5892	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncovered his face and rose. The congregation rose also and settled
  5893	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain on its benches. Mr Kernan restored his hat to its original
  5894	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tposition on his knee and presented an attentive face to the preacher.
  5895	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe preacher turned back each wide sleeve of his surplice with an
  5896	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\telaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of faces. Then he
  5897	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
  5898	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5899	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5900	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5901	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_“For the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the
  5902	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildren of light. Wherefore make unto yourselves friends out of the
  5903	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into
  5904	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teverlasting dwellings.”_
  5905	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5906	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5907	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5908	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Purdon developed the text with resonant assurance. It was one of
  5909	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe most difficult texts in all the Scriptures, he said, to interpret
  5910	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproperly. It was a text which might seem to the casual observer at
  5911	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvariance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by Jesus Christ.
  5912	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut, he told his hearers, the text had seemed to him specially adapted
  5913	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world
  5914	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of worldlings. It
  5915	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a text for business men and professional men. Jesus Christ, with
  5916	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis divine understanding of every cranny of our human nature, understood
  5917	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat all men were not called to the religious life, that by far the vast
  5918	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmajority were forced to live in the world and, to a certain extent,
  5919	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the world: and in this sentence He designed to give them a word of
  5920	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounsel, setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those
  5921	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the least solicitous in
  5922	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatters religious.
  5923	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5924	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying,
  5925	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world speaking to his
  5926	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow-men. He came to speak to business men and he would speak to them
  5927	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a businesslike way. If he might use the metaphor, he said, he was
  5928	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir spiritual accountant; and he wished each and every one of his
  5929	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thearers to open his books, the books of his spiritual life, and see if
  5930	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey tallied accurately with conscience.
  5931	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5932	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster. He understood our little
  5933	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailings, understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature, understood
  5934	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe temptations of this life. We might have had, we all had from time to
  5935	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime, our temptations: we might have, we all had, our failings. But one
  5936	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing only, he said, he would ask of his hearers. And that was: to be
  5937	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstraight and manly with God. If their accounts tallied in every point to
  5938	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay:
  5939	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5940	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I have verified my accounts. I find all well.”
  5941	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5942	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut if, as might happen, there were some discrepancies, to admit the
  5943	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttruth, to be frank and say like a man:
  5944	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5945	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I have looked into my accounts. I find this wrong and this wrong.
  5946	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut, with God’s grace, I will rectify this and this. I will set right my
  5947	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccounts.”
  5948	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5949	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5950	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5951	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE DEAD
  5952	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5953	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLILY, the caretaker’s daughter, was literally run off her feet. Hardly
  5954	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office
  5955	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy
  5956	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare
  5957	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thallway to let in another guest. It was well for her she had not to
  5958	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought
  5959	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies’
  5960	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and
  5961	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the
  5962	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask
  5963	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther who had come.
  5964	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5965	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan’s annual dance.
  5966	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEverybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends
  5967	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the family, the members of Julia’s choir, any of Kate’s pupils that
  5968	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane’s pupils too. Never
  5969	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce had it fallen flat. For years and years it had gone off in splendid
  5970	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstyle as long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and Julia, after
  5971	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe death of their brother Pat, had left the house in Stoney Batter and
  5972	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them in the dark gaunt
  5973	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse on Usher’s Island, the upper part of which they had rented from
  5974	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor. That was a good thirty
  5975	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyears ago if it was a day. Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in
  5976	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshort clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she had the
  5977	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\torgan in Haddington Road. She had been through the Academy and gave
  5978	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta pupils’ concert every year in the upper room of the Antient Concert
  5979	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRooms. Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class families on the
  5980	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were, her aunts also did their
  5981	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshare. Julia, though she was quite grey, was still the leading soprano
  5982	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Adam and Eve’s, and Kate, being too feeble to go about much, gave
  5983	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusic lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room.
  5984	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLily, the caretaker’s daughter, did housemaid’s work for them. Though
  5985	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir life was modest they believed in eating well; the best of
  5986	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teverything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best
  5987	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottled stout. But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders so that she
  5988	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgot on well with her three mistresses. They were fussy, that was all.
  5989	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut the only thing they would not stand was back answers.
  5990	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5991	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it
  5992	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas long after ten o’clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his
  5993	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might
  5994	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturn up screwed. They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane’s
  5995	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it
  5996	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sometimes very hard to manage him. Freddy Malins always came late
  5997	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what
  5998	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel
  5999	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor Freddy come.
  6000	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6001	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Mr Conroy,” said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him,
  6002	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming. Good-night, Mrs
  6003	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConroy.”
  6004	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6005	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll engage they did,” said Gabriel, “but they forget that my wife here
  6006	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttakes three mortal hours to dress herself.”
  6007	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6008	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily led
  6009	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:
  6010	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6011	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Kate, here’s Mrs Conroy.”
  6012	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6013	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them
  6014	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkissed Gabriel’s wife, said she must be perished alive and asked was
  6015	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel with her.
  6016	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6017	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I’ll follow,”
  6018	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t called out Gabriel from the dark.
  6019	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6020	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went
  6021	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupstairs, laughing, to the ladies’ dressing-room. A light fringe of snow
  6022	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the
  6023	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a
  6024	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsqueaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air
  6025	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.
  6026	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6027	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is it snowing again, Mr Conroy?” asked Lily.
  6028	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6029	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat.
  6030	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and
  6031	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced at her. She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and
  6032	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her look still paler.
  6033	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest
  6034	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstep nursing a rag doll.
  6035	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6036	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, Lily,” he answered, “and I think we’re in for a night of it.”
  6037	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6038	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping
  6039	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to
  6040	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat
  6041	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarefully at the end of a shelf.
  6042	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6043	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me, Lily,” he said in a friendly tone, “do you still go to
  6044	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool?”
  6045	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6046	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O no, sir,” she answered. “I’m done schooling this year and more.”
  6047	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6048	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, then,” said Gabriel gaily, “I suppose we’ll be going to your wedding
  6049	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone of these fine days with your young man, eh?”
  6050	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6051	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great
  6052	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbitterness:
  6053	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6054	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of
  6055	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou.”
  6056	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6057	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel coloured as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without
  6058	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his
  6059	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuffler at his patent-leather shoes.
  6060	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6061	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a stout tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks pushed
  6062	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupwards even to his forehead where it scattered itself in a few formless
  6063	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpatches of pale red; and on his hairless face there scintillated
  6064	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trestlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses
  6065	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich screened his delicate and restless eyes. His glossy black hair was
  6066	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where
  6067	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat.
  6068	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6069	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his
  6070	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. Then he took a coin
  6071	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trapidly from his pocket.
  6072	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6073	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O Lily,” he said, thrusting it into her hands, “it’s Christmas-time,
  6074	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tisn’t it? Just ... here’s a little....”
  6075	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6076	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked rapidly towards the door.
  6077	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6078	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O no, sir!” cried the girl, following him. “Really, sir, I wouldn’t
  6079	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake it.”
  6080	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6081	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Christmas-time! Christmas-time!” said Gabriel, almost trotting to the
  6082	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.
  6083	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6084	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:
  6085	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6086	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, thank you, sir.”
  6087	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6088	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish,
  6089	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of
  6090	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeet. He was still discomposed by the girl’s bitter and sudden retort.
  6091	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his
  6092	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a
  6093	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He
  6094	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas undecided about the lines from Robert Browning for he feared they
  6095	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be above the heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would
  6096	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. The
  6097	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindelicate clacking of the men’s heels and the shuffling of their soles
  6098	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He would
  6099	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonly make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they
  6100	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould not understand. They would think that he was airing his superior
  6101	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teducation. He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl
  6102	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His whole speech was a
  6103	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmistake from first to last, an utter failure.
  6104	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6105	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJust then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies’ dressing-room.
  6106	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis aunts were two small plainly dressed old women. Aunt Julia was an
  6107	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinch or so the taller. Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears,
  6108	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her large flaccid
  6109	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface. Though she was stout in build and stood erect her slow eyes and
  6110	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where
  6111	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe was or where she was going. Aunt Kate was more vivacious. Her
  6112	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface, healthier than her sister’s, was all puckers and creases, like a
  6113	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned
  6114	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway, had not lost its ripe nut colour.
  6115	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6116	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey both kissed Gabriel frankly. He was their favourite nephew, the son
  6117	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J. Conroy of the
  6118	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPort and Docks.
  6119	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6120	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta tells me you’re not going to take a cab back to Monkstown
  6121	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttonight, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate.
  6122	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6123	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” said Gabriel, turning to his wife, “we had quite enough of that
  6124	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast year, hadn’t we? Don’t you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta
  6125	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgot out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind
  6126	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a
  6127	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdreadful cold.”
  6128	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6129	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word.
  6130	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6131	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,” she said. “You can’t be too
  6132	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcareful.”
  6133	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6134	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But as for Gretta there,” said Gabriel, “she’d walk home in the snow if
  6135	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe were let.”
  6136	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6137	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Conroy laughed.
  6138	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6139	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Don’t mind him, Aunt Kate,” she said. “He’s really an awful bother,
  6140	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat with green shades for Tom’s eyes at night and making him do the
  6141	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The poor child! And
  6142	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe simply hates the sight of it!... O, but you’ll never guess what he
  6143	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmakes me wear now!”
  6144	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6145	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose
  6146	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadmiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face
  6147	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand hair. The two aunts laughed heartily too, for Gabriel’s solicitude
  6148	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a standing joke with them.
  6149	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6150	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Goloshes!” said Mrs Conroy. “That’s the latest. Whenever it’s wet
  6151	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderfoot I must put on my goloshes. Tonight even he wanted me to put
  6152	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem on, but I wouldn’t. The next thing he’ll buy me will be a diving
  6153	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuit.”
  6154	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6155	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly while Aunt
  6156	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke. The
  6157	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmile soon faded from Aunt Julia’s face and her mirthless eyes were
  6158	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirected towards her nephew’s face. After a pause she asked:
  6159	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6160	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what are goloshes, Gabriel?”
  6161	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6162	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Goloshes, Julia!” exclaimed her sister “Goodness me, don’t you know
  6163	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat goloshes are? You wear them over your ... over your boots, Gretta,
  6164	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tisn’t it?”
  6165	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6166	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mrs Conroy. “Guttapercha things. We both have a pair now.
  6167	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel says everyone wears them on the continent.”
  6168	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6169	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, on the continent,” murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly.
  6170	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6171	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:
  6172	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6173	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s nothing very wonderful but Gretta thinks it very funny because she
  6174	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsays the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.”
  6175	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6176	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But tell me, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. “Of course,
  6177	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou’ve seen about the room. Gretta was saying....”
  6178	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6179	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, the room is all right,” replied Gabriel. “I’ve taken one in the
  6180	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGresham.”
  6181	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6182	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To be sure,” said Aunt Kate, “by far the best thing to do. And the
  6183	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildren, Gretta, you’re not anxious about them?”
  6184	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6185	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, for one night,” said Mrs Conroy. “Besides, Bessie will look after
  6186	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem.”
  6187	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6188	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To be sure,” said Aunt Kate again. “What a comfort it is to have a girl
  6189	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike that, one you can depend on! There’s that Lily, I’m sure I don’t
  6190	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow what has come over her lately. She’s not the girl she was at all.”
  6191	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6192	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point but she
  6193	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbroke off suddenly to gaze after her sister who had wandered down the
  6194	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.
  6195	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6196	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, I ask you,” she said almost testily, “where is Julia going? Julia!
  6197	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia! Where are you going?”
  6198	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6199	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced
  6200	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblandly:
  6201	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6202	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here’s Freddy.”
  6203	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6204	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the
  6205	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door was opened
  6206	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside
  6207	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thurriedly and whispered into his ear:
  6208	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6209	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he’s all right, and
  6210	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdon’t let him up if he’s screwed. I’m sure he’s screwed. I’m sure he
  6211	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis.”
  6212	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6213	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could
  6214	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy
  6215	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMalins’ laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.
  6216	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6217	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s such a relief,” said Aunt Kate to Mrs Conroy, “that Gabriel is
  6218	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\there. I always feel easier in my mind when he’s here.... Julia, there’s
  6219	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your
  6220	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.”
  6221	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6222	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy
  6223	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tskin, who was passing out with his partner said:
  6224	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6225	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?”
  6226	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6227	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Julia,” said Aunt Kate summarily, “and here’s Mr Browne and Miss
  6228	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFurlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.”
  6229	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6230	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m the man for the ladies,” said Mr Browne, pursing his lips until
  6231	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles. “You know, Miss
  6232	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMorkan, the reason they are so fond of me is----”
  6233	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6234	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of
  6235	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tearshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room. The
  6236	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmiddle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to
  6237	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tend, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening
  6238	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and
  6239	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top
  6240	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands
  6241	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand sweets. At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were
  6242	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstanding, drinking hop-bitters.
  6243	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6244	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to
  6245	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they said they never took
  6246	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything strong he opened three bottles of lemonade for them. Then
  6247	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the asked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the
  6248	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdecanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky. The young
  6249	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmen eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip.
  6250	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6251	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God help me,” he said, smiling, “it’s the doctor’s orders.”
  6252	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6253	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies
  6254	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and
  6255	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The boldest said:
  6256	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6257	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, now, Mr Browne, I’m sure the doctor never ordered anything of the
  6258	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkind.”
  6259	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6260	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling mimicry:
  6261	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6262	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, you see, I’m like the famous Mrs Cassidy, who is reported to have
  6263	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid: ‘Now, Mary Grimes, if I don’t take it, make me take it, for I feel
  6264	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI want it.’”
  6265	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6266	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had
  6267	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one
  6268	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong, who was one
  6269	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Mary Jane’s pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty
  6270	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaltz she had played; and Mr Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned
  6271	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpromptly to the two young men who were more appreciative.
  6272	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6273	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly
  6274	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclapping her hands and crying:
  6275	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6276	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Quadrilles! Quadrilles!”
  6277	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6278	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tClose on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:
  6279	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6280	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!”
  6281	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6282	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, here’s Mr Bergin and Mr Kerrigan,” said Mary Jane. “Mr Kerrigan,
  6283	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr
  6284	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBergin. O, that’ll just do now.”
  6285	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6286	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Three ladies, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate.
  6287	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6288	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the
  6289	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly.
  6290	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6291	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Miss Daly, you’re really awfully good, after playing for the last
  6292	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo dances, but really we’re so short of ladies tonight.”
  6293	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6294	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t mind in the least, Miss Morkan.”
  6295	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6296	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But I’ve a nice partner for you, Mr Bartell D’Arcy, the tenor. I’ll get
  6297	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.”
  6298	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6299	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Lovely voice, lovely voice!” said Aunt Kate.
  6300	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6301	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane
  6302	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tled her recruits quickly from the room. They had hardly gone when Aunt
  6303	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something.
  6304	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6305	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is the matter, Julia?” asked Aunt Kate anxiously. “Who is it?”
  6306	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6307	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her
  6308	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:
  6309	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6310	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.”
  6311	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6312	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins
  6313	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty, was of
  6314	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel’s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy
  6315	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his
  6316	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a
  6317	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His
  6318	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look
  6319	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had
  6320	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the
  6321	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye.
  6322	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6323	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-evening, Freddy,” said Aunt Julia.
  6324	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6325	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFreddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an
  6326	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then,
  6327	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseeing that Mr Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed
  6328	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the
  6329	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstory he had just told to Gabriel.
  6330	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6331	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He’s not so bad, is he?” said Aunt Kate to Gabriel.
  6332	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6333	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel’s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered:
  6334	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6335	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, no, hardly noticeable.”
  6336	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6337	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, isn’t he a terrible fellow!” she said. “And his poor mother made
  6338	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim take the pledge on New Year’s Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the
  6339	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawing-room.”
  6340	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6341	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBefore leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr Browne by
  6342	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr Browne
  6343	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins:
  6344	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6345	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, then, Teddy, I’m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade
  6346	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust to buck you up.”
  6347	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6348	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFreddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer
  6349	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taside impatiently but Mr Browne, having first called Freddy Malins’
  6350	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a
  6351	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull glass of lemonade. Freddy Malins’ left hand accepted the
  6352	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglass mechanically, his right hand being engaged in the mechanical
  6353	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treadjustment of his dress. Mr Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling
  6354	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins
  6355	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texploded, before he had well reached the climax of his story, in a kink
  6356	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down his untasted and
  6357	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toverflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards
  6358	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand forwards into his left eye, repeating words of his last phrase as
  6359	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell as his fit of laughter would allow him.
  6360	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6361	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6362	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6363	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece,
  6364	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room. He
  6365	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he
  6366	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they
  6367	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad begged Mary Jane to play something. Four young men, who had come
  6368	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the
  6369	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpiano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes. The only
  6370	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands
  6371	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tracing along the key-board or lifted from it at the pauses like those
  6372	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her
  6373	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\telbow to turn the page.
  6374	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6375	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel’s eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax
  6376	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the piano. A
  6377	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpicture of the balcony scene in _Romeo and Juliet_ hung there and beside
  6378	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt
  6379	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl.
  6380	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProbably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had
  6381	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen taught for one year. His mother had worked for him as a birthday
  6382	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpresent a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes’ heads upon it,
  6383	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons. It was strange
  6384	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call
  6385	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther the brains carrier of the Morkan family. Both she and Julia had
  6386	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister. Her
  6387	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tphotograph stood before the pierglass. She held an open book on her
  6388	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who, dressed
  6389	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a man-o’-war suit, lay at her feet. It was she who had chosen the
  6390	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family
  6391	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife. Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan
  6392	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, thanks to her, Gabriel himself had taken his degree in the Royal
  6393	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUniversity. A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen
  6394	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topposition to his marriage. Some slighting phrases she had used still
  6395	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trankled in his memory; she had once spoken of Gretta as being country
  6396	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcute and that was not true of Gretta at all. It was Gretta who had
  6397	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnursed her during all her last long illness in their house at Monkstown.
  6398	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6399	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was
  6400	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplaying again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and
  6401	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart.
  6402	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep
  6403	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toctave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and
  6404	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trolling up her music nervously, she escaped from the room. The most
  6405	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had
  6406	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had
  6407	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome back when the piano had stopped.
  6408	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6409	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors.
  6410	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and
  6411	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large
  6412	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish
  6413	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdevice and motto.
  6414	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6415	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen they had taken their places she said abruptly:
  6416	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6417	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I have a crow to pluck with you.”
  6418	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6419	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“With me?” said Gabriel.
  6420	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6421	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe nodded her head gravely.
  6422	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6423	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is it?” asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner.
  6424	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6425	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who is G. C.?” answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon him.
  6426	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6427	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not
  6428	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderstand, when she said bluntly:
  6429	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6430	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for _The Daily
  6431	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tExpress_. Now, aren’t you ashamed of yourself?”
  6432	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6433	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why should I be ashamed of myself?” asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes
  6434	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand trying to smile.
  6435	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6436	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I’m ashamed of you,” said Miss Ivors frankly. “To say you’d write
  6437	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a paper like that. I didn’t think you were a West Briton.”
  6438	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6439	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel’s face. It was true that he
  6440	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrote a literary column every Wednesday in _The Daily Express_, for
  6441	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West
  6442	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBriton surely. The books he received for review were almost more welcome
  6443	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan the paltry cheque. He loved to feel the covers and turn over the
  6444	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpages of newly printed books. Nearly every day when his teaching in the
  6445	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollege was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second-hand
  6446	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbooksellers, to Hickey’s on Bachelor’s Walk, to Webb’s or Massey’s on
  6447	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAston’s Quay, or to O’Clohissey’s in the by-street. He did not know how
  6448	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics.
  6449	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut they were friends of many years’ standing and their careers had been
  6450	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparallel, first at the university and then as teachers: he could not
  6451	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trisk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking his eyes and
  6452	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in
  6453	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twriting reviews of books.
  6454	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6455	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and
  6456	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said
  6457	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a soft friendly tone:
  6458	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6459	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.”
  6460	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6461	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen they were together again she spoke of the University question and
  6462	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review
  6463	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Browning’s poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she
  6464	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly:
  6465	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6466	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Mr Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this
  6467	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsummer? We’re going to stay there a whole month. It will be splendid out
  6468	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr Clancy is coming, and Mr Kilkelly
  6469	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid for Gretta too if she’d come.
  6470	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe’s from Connacht, isn’t she?”
  6471	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6472	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Her people are,” said Gabriel shortly.
  6473	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6474	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But you will come, won’t you?” said Miss Ivors, laying her warm hand
  6475	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teagerly on his arm.
  6476	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6477	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The fact is,” said Gabriel, “I have just arranged to go----”
  6478	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6479	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Go where?” asked Miss Ivors.
  6480	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6481	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows
  6482	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand so----”
  6483	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6484	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But where?” asked Miss Ivors.
  6485	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6486	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,” said
  6487	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel awkwardly.
  6488	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6489	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And why do you go to France and Belgium,” said Miss Ivors, “instead of
  6490	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvisiting your own land?”
  6491	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6492	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well,” said Gabriel, “it’s partly to keep in touch with the languages
  6493	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand partly for a change.”
  6494	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6495	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And haven’t you your own language to keep in touch with--Irish?” asked
  6496	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Ivors.
  6497	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6498	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well,” said Gabriel, “if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my
  6499	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanguage.”
  6500	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6501	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTheir neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination. Gabriel
  6502	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under
  6503	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead.
  6504	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6505	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And haven’t you your own land to visit,” continued Miss Ivors, “that
  6506	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?”
  6507	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6508	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, to tell you the truth,” retorted Gabriel suddenly, “I’m sick of my
  6509	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\town country, sick of it!”
  6510	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6511	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why?” asked Miss Ivors.
  6512	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6513	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him.
  6514	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6515	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why?” repeated Miss Ivors.
  6516	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6517	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss
  6518	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIvors said warmly:
  6519	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6520	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course, you’ve no answer.”
  6521	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6522	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with
  6523	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreat energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on
  6524	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel
  6525	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a
  6526	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to
  6527	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstart again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:
  6528	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6529	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“West Briton!”
  6530	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6531	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the
  6532	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom where Freddy Malins’ mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble old
  6533	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son’s and
  6534	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and that
  6535	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good
  6536	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to
  6537	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a
  6538	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her.
  6539	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and
  6540	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof all the friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel
  6541	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with
  6542	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an
  6543	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not
  6544	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto have answered her like that. But she had no right to call him a West
  6545	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBriton before people, even in joke. She had tried to make him ridiculous
  6546	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore people, heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit’s eyes.
  6547	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6548	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples.
  6549	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen she reached him she said into his ear:
  6550	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6551	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gabriel, Aunt Kate wants to know won’t you carve the goose as usual.
  6552	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Daly will carve the ham and I’ll do the pudding.”
  6553	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6554	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All right,” said Gabriel.
  6555	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6556	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over
  6557	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso that we’ll have the table to ourselves.”
  6558	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6559	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Were you dancing?” asked Gabriel.
  6560	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6561	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course I was. Didn’t you see me? What row had you with Molly Ivors?”
  6562	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6563	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No row. Why? Did she say so?”
  6564	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6565	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Something like that. I’m trying to get that Mr D’Arcy to sing. He’s
  6566	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of conceit, I think.”
  6567	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6568	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There was no row,” said Gabriel moodily, “only she wanted me to go for
  6569	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn’t.”
  6570	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6571	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump.
  6572	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6573	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, do go, Gabriel,” she cried. “I’d love to see Galway again.”
  6574	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6575	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You can go if you like,” said Gabriel coldly.
  6576	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6577	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs Malins and said:
  6578	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6579	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s a nice husband for you, Mrs Malins.”
  6580	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6581	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile she was threading her way back across the room Mrs Malins, without
  6582	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful
  6583	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplaces there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery. Her son-in-law
  6584	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing. Her
  6585	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tson-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a beautiful big fish
  6586	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner.
  6587	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6588	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming near he
  6589	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to think again about his speech and about the quotation. When he
  6590	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel
  6591	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleft the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the
  6592	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twindow. The room had already cleared and from the back room came
  6593	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe clatter of plates and knives. Those who still remained in the
  6594	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawing-room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in
  6595	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle groups. Gabriel’s warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane
  6596	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be to
  6597	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park! The
  6598	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsnow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright
  6599	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcap on the top of the Wellington Monument. How much more pleasant it
  6600	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be there than at the supper-table!
  6601	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6602	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories,
  6603	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning. He repeated to
  6604	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself a phrase he had written in his review: “One feels that one is
  6605	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistening to a thought-tormented music.” Miss Ivors had praised the
  6606	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treview. Was she sincere? Had she really any life of her own behind all
  6607	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther propagandism? There had never been any ill-feeling between them
  6608	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuntil that night. It unnerved him to think that she would be at the
  6609	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her critical
  6610	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquizzing eyes. Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his
  6611	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeech. An idea came into his mind and gave him courage. He would
  6612	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: “Ladies and Gentlemen, the
  6613	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgeneration which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but
  6614	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour,
  6615	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation
  6616	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat is growing up around us seems to me to lack.” Very good: that
  6617	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas one for Miss Ivors. What did he care that his aunts were only two
  6618	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tignorant old women?
  6619	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6620	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA murmur in the room attracted his attention. Mr Browne was advancing
  6621	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned upon his arm,
  6622	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmiling and hanging her head. An irregular musketry of applause escorted
  6623	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther also as far as the piano and then, as Mary Jane seated herself on
  6624	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so as to pitch
  6625	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther voice fairly into the room, gradually ceased. Gabriel recognised the
  6626	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprelude. It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia’s--_Arrayed for the
  6627	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBridal_. Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit
  6628	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she
  6629	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not miss even the smallest of the grace notes. To follow the
  6630	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice, without looking at the singer’s face, was to feel and share the
  6631	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcitement of swift and secure flight. Gabriel applauded loudly with all
  6632	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from
  6633	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe invisible supper-table. It sounded so genuine that a little
  6634	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcolour struggled into Aunt Julia’s face as she bent to replace in the
  6635	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusic-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her initials on the
  6636	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcover. Freddy Malins, who had listened with his head perched sideways to
  6637	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thear her better, was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and
  6638	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly
  6639	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin acquiescence. At last, when he could clap no more, he stood up
  6640	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized
  6641	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand held in both his hands, shaking it when words failed him or the
  6642	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcatch in his voice proved too much for him.
  6643	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6644	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was just telling my mother,” he said, “I never heard you sing so
  6645	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight. Now!
  6646	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWould you believe that now? That’s the truth. Upon my word and honour
  6647	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat’s the truth. I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so ... so
  6648	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclear and fresh, never.”
  6649	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6650	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as
  6651	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe released her hand from his grasp. Mr Browne extended his open hand
  6652	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a
  6653	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshowman introducing a prodigy to an audience:
  6654	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6655	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!”
  6656	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6657	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned
  6658	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto him and said:
  6659	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6660	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Browne, if you’re serious you might make a worse discovery. All
  6661	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI can say is I never heard her sing half so well as long as I am coming
  6662	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\there. And that’s the honest truth.”
  6663	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6664	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Neither did I,” said Mr Browne. “I think her voice has greatly
  6665	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timproved.”
  6666	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6667	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:
  6668	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6669	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thirty years ago I hadn’t a bad voice as voices go.”
  6670	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6671	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I often told Julia,” said Aunt Kate emphatically, “that she was simply
  6672	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrown away in that choir. But she never would be said by me.”
  6673	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6674	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a
  6675	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trefractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her, a vague smile
  6676	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof reminiscence playing on her face.
  6677	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6678	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” continued Aunt Kate, “she wouldn’t be said or led by anyone,
  6679	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslaving there in that choir night and day, night and day. Six o’clock on
  6680	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChristmas morning! And all for what?”
  6681	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6682	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, isn’t it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?” asked Mary Jane,
  6683	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwisting round on the piano-stool and smiling.
  6684	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6685	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:
  6686	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6687	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it’s not at
  6688	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that
  6689	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers of
  6690	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboys over their heads. I suppose it is for the good of the Church if the
  6691	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpope does it. But it’s not just, Mary Jane, and it’s not right.”
  6692	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6693	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in
  6694	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdefence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but Mary Jane,
  6695	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically:
  6696	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6697	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, Aunt Kate, you’re giving scandal to Mr Browne who is of the other
  6698	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersuasion.”
  6699	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6700	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate turned to Mr Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his
  6701	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treligion, and said hastily:
  6702	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6703	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I don’t question the pope’s being right. I’m only a stupid old woman
  6704	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand I wouldn’t presume to do such a thing. But there’s such a thing as
  6705	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommon everyday politeness and gratitude. And if I were in Julia’s place
  6706	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’d tell that Father Healey straight up to his face....”
  6707	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6708	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And besides, Aunt Kate,” said Mary Jane, “we really are all hungry and
  6709	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.”
  6710	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6711	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,” added Mr Browne.
  6712	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6713	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So that we had better go to supper,” said Mary Jane, “and finish the
  6714	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscussion afterwards.”
  6715	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6716	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife and Mary
  6717	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper. But Miss Ivors,
  6718	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay.
  6719	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her
  6720	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime.
  6721	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6722	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But only for ten minutes, Molly,” said Mrs Conroy. “That won’t delay
  6723	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou.”
  6724	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6725	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To take a pick itself,” said Mary Jane, “after all your dancing.”
  6726	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6727	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I really couldn’t,” said Miss Ivors.
  6728	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6729	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I am afraid you didn’t enjoy yourself at all,” said Mary Jane
  6730	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thopelessly.
  6731	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6732	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ever so much, I assure you,” said Miss Ivors, “but you really must let
  6733	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme run off now.”
  6734	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6735	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But how can you get home?” asked Mrs Conroy.
  6736	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6737	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, it’s only two steps up the quay.”
  6738	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6739	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel hesitated a moment and said:
  6740	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6741	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I’ll see you home if you are really
  6742	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobliged to go.”
  6743	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6744	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Miss Ivors broke away from them.
  6745	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6746	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I won’t hear of it,” she cried. “For goodness’ sake go in to your
  6747	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppers and don’t mind me. I’m quite well able to take care of myself.”
  6748	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6749	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, you’re the comical girl, Molly,” said Mrs Conroy frankly.
  6750	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6751	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_Beannacht libh_,” cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran down the
  6752	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstaircase.
  6753	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6754	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face,
  6755	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile Mrs Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door.
  6756	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she
  6757	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing. He stared
  6758	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblankly down the staircase.
  6759	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6760	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost
  6761	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twringing her hands in despair.
  6762	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6763	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where is Gabriel?” she cried. “Where on earth is Gabriel? There’s
  6764	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teveryone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to carve the goose!”
  6765	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6766	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here I am, Aunt Kate!” cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, “ready to
  6767	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarve a flock of geese, if necessary.”
  6768	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6769	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on
  6770	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham,
  6771	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat
  6772	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef.
  6773	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBetween these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little
  6774	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks
  6775	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a
  6776	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled
  6777	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talmonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna
  6778	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfigs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of
  6779	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase
  6780	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there
  6781	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges
  6782	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one
  6783	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontaining port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano
  6784	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three
  6785	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsquads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to
  6786	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and
  6787	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tred labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green
  6788	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsashes.
  6789	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6790	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked
  6791	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the goose. He
  6792	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing
  6793	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.
  6794	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6795	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Furlong, what shall I send you?” he asked. “A wing or a slice of
  6796	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe breast?”
  6797	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6798	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Just a small slice of the breast.”
  6799	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6800	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Higgins, what for you?”
  6801	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6802	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, anything at all, Mr Conroy.”
  6803	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6804	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham
  6805	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury
  6806	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpotatoes wrapped in a white napkin. This was Mary Jane’s idea and she
  6807	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said that
  6808	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough
  6809	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her and she hoped she might never eat worse. Mary Jane waited on
  6810	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt
  6811	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale
  6812	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies. There was a
  6813	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreat deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders
  6814	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers.
  6815	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the
  6816	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst round without serving himself. Everyone protested loudly so that
  6817	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the
  6818	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarving hot work. Mary Jane settled down quietly to her supper but Aunt
  6819	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the table, walking on
  6820	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teach other’s heels, getting in each other’s way and giving each other
  6821	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunheeded orders. Mr Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their
  6822	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppers and so did Gabriel but they said they were time enough so that,
  6823	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat last, Freddy Malins stood up and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her
  6824	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown on her chair amid general laughter.
  6825	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6826	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:
  6827	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6828	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing
  6829	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlet him or her speak.”
  6830	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6831	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came
  6832	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him.
  6833	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6834	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Very well,” said Gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory
  6835	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdraught, “kindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few
  6836	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminutes.”
  6837	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6838	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the
  6839	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable covered Lily’s removal of the plates. The subject of talk was the
  6840	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topera company which was then at the Theatre Royal. Mr Bartell D’Arcy,
  6841	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe tenor, a dark-complexioned young man with a smart moustache, praised
  6842	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong
  6843	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought she had a rather vulgar style of production. Freddy Malins said
  6844	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was a negro chieftain singing in the second part of the Gaiety
  6845	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard.
  6846	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6847	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Have you heard him?” he asked Mr Bartell D’Arcy across the table.
  6848	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6849	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” answered Mr Bartell D’Arcy carelessly.
  6850	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6851	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Because,” Freddy Malins explained, “now I’d be curious to hear your
  6852	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topinion of him. I think he has a grand voice.”
  6853	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6854	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,” said Mr Browne
  6855	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamiliarly to the table.
  6856	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6857	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And why couldn’t he have a voice too?” asked Freddy Malins sharply. “Is
  6858	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit because he’s only a black?”
  6859	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6860	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the
  6861	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlegitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a pass for _Mignon_.
  6862	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor
  6863	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGeorgina Burns. Mr Browne could go back farther still, to the old
  6864	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tItalian companies that used to come to Dublin--Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka,
  6865	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCampanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were
  6866	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in
  6867	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be
  6868	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpacked night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung
  6869	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfive encores to _Let me like a Soldier fall_, introducing a high C every
  6870	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm
  6871	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunyoke the horses from the carriage of some great _prima donna_ and pull
  6872	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther themselves through the streets to her hotel. Why did they never play
  6873	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe grand old operas now, he asked, _Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia?_ Because
  6874	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey could not get the voices to sing them: that was why.
  6875	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6876	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Oh, well,” said Mr Bartell D’Arcy, “I presume there are as good singers
  6877	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoday as there were then.”
  6878	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6879	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where are they?” asked Mr Browne defiantly.
  6880	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6881	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“In London, Paris, Milan,” said Mr Bartell D’Arcy warmly. “I suppose
  6882	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCaruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the men
  6883	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou have mentioned.”
  6884	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6885	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Maybe so,” said Mr Browne. “But I may tell you I doubt it strongly.”
  6886	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6887	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I’d give anything to hear Caruso sing,” said Mary Jane.
  6888	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6889	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“For me,” said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, “there was only
  6890	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone tenor. To please me, I mean. But I suppose none of you ever heard of
  6891	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim.”
  6892	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6893	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who was he, Miss Morkan?” asked Mr Bartell D’Arcy politely.
  6894	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6895	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“His name,” said Aunt Kate, “was Parkinson. I heard him when he was in
  6896	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever
  6897	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tput into a man’s throat.”
  6898	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6899	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Strange,” said Mr Bartell D’Arcy. “I never even heard of him.”
  6900	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6901	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,” said Mr Browne. “I remember hearing of
  6902	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told Parkinson but he’s too far back for me.”
  6903	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6904	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A beautiful pure sweet mellow English tenor,” said Aunt Kate with
  6905	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenthusiasm.
  6906	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6907	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table.
  6908	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe clatter of forks and spoons began again. Gabriel’s wife served out
  6909	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table. Midway
  6910	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry
  6911	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The pudding was of Aunt
  6912	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia’s making and she received praises for it from all quarters. She
  6913	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\therself said that it was not quite brown enough.
  6914	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6915	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,” said Mr Browne, “that I’m brown enough for
  6916	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou because, you know, I’m all brown.”
  6917	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6918	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of
  6919	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had
  6920	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it
  6921	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith his pudding. He had been told that celery was a capital thing for
  6922	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe blood and he was just then under doctor’s care. Mrs Malins, who had
  6923	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen silent all through the supper, said that her son was going down to
  6924	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount Melleray,
  6925	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and
  6926	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests.
  6927	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6928	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And do you mean to say,” asked Mr Browne incredulously, “that a chap
  6929	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcan go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the
  6930	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfat of the land and then come away without paying anything?”
  6931	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6932	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave.”
  6933	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t said Mary Jane.
  6934	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6935	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,” said Mr Browne
  6936	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandidly.
  6937	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6938	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in
  6939	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they did it for.
  6940	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6941	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s the rule of the order,” said Aunt Kate firmly.
  6942	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6943	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, but why?” asked Mr Browne.
  6944	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6945	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr Browne still
  6946	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he
  6947	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by
  6948	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the sinners in the outside world. The explanation was not very clear
  6949	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor Mr Browne grinned and said:
  6950	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6951	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I like that idea very much but wouldn’t a comfortable spring bed do
  6952	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem as well as a coffin?”
  6953	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6954	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The coffin,” said Mary Jane, “is to remind them of their last end.”
  6955	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6956	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the
  6957	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable during which Mrs Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in
  6958	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan indistinct undertone:
  6959	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6960	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They are very good men, the monks, very pious men.”
  6961	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6962	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates
  6963	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all
  6964	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr Bartell D’Arcy
  6965	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trefused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and
  6966	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled.
  6967	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation
  6968	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by
  6969	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at
  6970	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen
  6971	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpatted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence came and
  6972	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel pushed back his chair.
  6973	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6974	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased
  6975	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taltogether. Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth
  6976	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand smiled nervously at the company. Meeting a row of upturned faces he
  6977	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\traised his eyes to the chandelier. The piano was playing a waltz tune
  6978	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door.
  6979	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPeople, perhaps, were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing
  6980	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music. The air was
  6981	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpure there. In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted
  6982	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith snow. The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that
  6983	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres.
  6984	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6985	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began:
  6986	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6987	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ladies and Gentlemen,
  6988	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6989	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a
  6990	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a
  6991	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeaker are all too inadequate.”
  6992	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6993	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no!” said Mr Browne.
  6994	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6995	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will
  6996	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while
  6997	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this
  6998	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toccasion.
  6999	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7000	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered
  7001	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether under this hospitable roof, around this hospitable board. It is
  7002	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot the first time that we have been the recipients--or perhaps, I had
  7003	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter say, the victims--of the hospitality of certain good ladies.”
  7004	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7005	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe made a circle in the air with his arm and paused. Everyone laughed or
  7006	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned crimson
  7007	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith pleasure. Gabriel went on more boldly:
  7008	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7009	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has
  7010	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so
  7011	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjealously as that of its hospitality. It is a tradition that is unique
  7012	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas far as my experience goes (and I have visited not a few places
  7013	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabroad) among the modern nations. Some would say, perhaps, that with us
  7014	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of. But granted even
  7015	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust will
  7016	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong be cultivated among us. Of one thing, at least, I am sure. As long
  7017	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid--and I wish from my
  7018	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart it may do so for many and many a long year to come--the tradition
  7019	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our
  7020	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down
  7021	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto our descendants, is still alive among us.”
  7022	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7023	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. It shot through
  7024	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel’s mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone away
  7025	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:
  7026	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7027	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ladies and Gentlemen,
  7028	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7029	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by
  7030	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnew ideas and new principles. It is serious and enthusiastic for
  7031	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I
  7032	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbelieve, in the main sincere. But we are living in a sceptical and, if
  7033	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that
  7034	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those
  7035	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tqualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged
  7036	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those great
  7037	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsingers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were living
  7038	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration, be
  7039	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalled spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at
  7040	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleast, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with
  7041	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those
  7042	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let
  7043	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdie.”
  7044	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7045	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hear, hear!” said Mr Browne loudly.
  7046	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7047	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But yet,” continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer
  7048	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinflection, “there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts
  7049	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of
  7050	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchanges, of absent faces that we miss here tonight. Our path through
  7051	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon
  7052	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work
  7053	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamong the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections
  7054	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours.
  7055	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7056	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Therefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any gloomy
  7057	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoralising intrude upon us here tonight. Here we are gathered together
  7058	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine.
  7059	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe are met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship,
  7060	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of
  7061	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_camaraderie_, and as the guests of--what shall I call them?--the Three
  7062	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGraces of the Dublin musical world.”
  7063	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7064	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Aunt Julia
  7065	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel had
  7066	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid.
  7067	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7068	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,” said Mary Jane.
  7069	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7070	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel,
  7071	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho continued in the same vein:
  7072	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7073	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ladies and Gentlemen,
  7074	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7075	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on
  7076	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanother occasion. I will not attempt to choose between them. The task
  7077	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For when I view
  7078	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good heart,
  7079	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her, or her
  7080	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing
  7081	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmust have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight, or, last
  7082	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful,
  7083	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen,
  7084	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat I do not know to which of them I should award the prize.”
  7085	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7086	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt
  7087	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia’s face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate’s eyes, hastened
  7088	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member
  7089	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly:
  7090	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7091	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Let us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health,
  7092	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue
  7093	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their
  7094	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprofession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in
  7095	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour hearts.”
  7096	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7097	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three
  7098	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr Browne as leader:
  7099	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7100	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7101	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they
  7102	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny.
  7103	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7104	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia
  7105	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the
  7106	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsingers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while
  7107	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey sang with emphasis:
  7108	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7109	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7110	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUnless he tells a lie, Unless he tells a lie.
  7111	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7112	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:
  7113	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7114	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7115	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they
  7116	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny.
  7117	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7118	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the
  7119	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time,
  7120	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFreddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high.
  7121	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7122	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7123	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7124	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so
  7125	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat Aunt Kate said:
  7126	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7127	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Close the door, somebody. Mrs Malins will get her death of cold.”
  7128	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7129	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,” said Mary Jane.
  7130	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7131	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Browne is everywhere,” said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice.
  7132	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7133	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary Jane laughed at her tone.
  7134	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7135	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Really,” she said archly, “he is very attentive.”
  7136	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7137	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He has been laid on here like the gas,” said Aunt Kate in the same
  7138	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttone, “all during the Christmas.”
  7139	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7140	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:
  7141	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7142	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope to
  7143	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoodness he didn’t hear me.”
  7144	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7145	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr Browne came in from the
  7146	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoorstep, laughing as if his heart would break. He was dressed in a long
  7147	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreen overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head
  7148	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan oval fur cap. He pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the
  7149	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in.
  7150	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7151	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,” he said.
  7152	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7153	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling
  7154	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:
  7155	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7156	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta not down yet?”
  7157	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7158	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s getting on her things, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate.
  7159	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7160	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who’s playing up there?” asked Gabriel.
  7161	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7162	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Nobody. They’re all gone.”
  7163	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7164	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O no, Aunt Kate,” said Mary Jane. “Bartell D’Arcy and Miss O’Callaghan
  7165	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taren’t gone yet.”
  7166	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7167	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,” said Gabriel.
  7168	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7169	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr Browne and said with a shiver:
  7170	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7171	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like
  7172	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat. I wouldn’t like to face your journey home at this hour.”
  7173	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7174	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’d like nothing better this minute,” said Mr Browne stoutly, “than a
  7175	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking
  7176	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoer between the shafts.”
  7177	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7178	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,” said Aunt Julia
  7179	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsadly.
  7180	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7181	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,” said Mary Jane, laughing.
  7182	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7183	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too.
  7184	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7185	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?” asked Mr Browne.
  7186	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7187	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,” explained
  7188	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel, “commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman, was a
  7189	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglue-boiler.”
  7190	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7191	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O now, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate, laughing, “he had a starch mill.”
  7192	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7193	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, glue or starch,” said Gabriel, “the old gentleman had a horse by
  7194	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman’s mill,
  7195	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking round and round in order to drive the mill. That was all very
  7196	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny. One fine day the old
  7197	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentleman thought he’d like to drive out with the quality to a military
  7198	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treview in the park.”
  7199	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7200	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Lord have mercy on his soul,” said Aunt Kate compassionately.
  7201	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7202	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Amen,” said Gabriel. “So the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed Johnny
  7203	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and
  7204	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back
  7205	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLane, I think.”
  7206	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7207	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone laughed, even Mrs Malins, at Gabriel’s manner and Aunt Kate
  7208	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
  7209	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7210	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O now, Gabriel, he didn’t live in Back Lane, really. Only the mill was
  7211	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere.”
  7212	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7213	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Out from the mansion of his forefathers,” continued Gabriel, “he drove
  7214	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Johnny. And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in
  7215	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsight of King Billy’s statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse
  7216	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKing Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill,
  7217	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyhow he began to walk round the statue.”
  7218	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7219	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the
  7220	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughter of the others.
  7221	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7222	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Round and round he went,” said Gabriel, “and the old gentleman, who was
  7223	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. ‘Go on, sir! What
  7224	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary conduct! Can’t
  7225	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderstand the horse!’”
  7226	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7227	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe peal of laughter which followed Gabriel’s imitation of the incident
  7228	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door. Mary Jane ran to
  7229	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topen it and let in Freddy Malins. Freddy Malins, with his hat well back
  7230	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton his head and his shoulders humped with cold, was puffing and steaming
  7231	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter his exertions.
  7232	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7233	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I could only get one cab,” he said.
  7234	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7235	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, we’ll find another along the quay,” said Gabriel.
  7236	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7237	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Aunt Kate. “Better not keep Mrs Malins standing in the
  7238	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdraught.”
  7239	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7240	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr Browne and,
  7241	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter many manœuvres, hoisted into the cab. Freddy Malins clambered
  7242	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat, Mr Browne
  7243	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thelping him with advice. At last she was settled comfortably and Freddy
  7244	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMalins invited Mr Browne into the cab. There was a good deal of confused
  7245	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalk, and then Mr Browne got into the cab. The cabman settled his
  7246	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trug over his knees, and bent down for the address. The confusion grew
  7247	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr
  7248	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrowne, each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab. The
  7249	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifficulty was to know where to drop Mr Browne along the route, and Aunt
  7250	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep
  7251	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter. As
  7252	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter. He popped his head in
  7253	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat, and
  7254	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttold his mother how the discussion was progressing, till at last Mr
  7255	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrowne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody’s
  7256	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughter:
  7257	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7258	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Do you know Trinity College?”
  7259	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7260	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, sir,” said the cabman.
  7261	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7262	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,” said Mr Browne,
  7263	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“and then we’ll tell you where to go. You understand now?”
  7264	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7265	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, sir,” said the cabman.
  7266	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7267	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Make like a bird for Trinity College.”
  7268	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7269	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Right, sir,” said the cabman.
  7270	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7271	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a
  7272	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchorus of laughter and adieus.
  7273	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7274	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel had not gone to the door with the others. He was in a dark part
  7275	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was standing near the top
  7276	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the first flight, in the shadow also. He could not see her face but
  7277	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the could see the terracotta and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which
  7278	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe shadow made appear black and white. It was his wife. She was leaning
  7279	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the banisters, listening to something. Gabriel was surprised at her
  7280	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstillness and strained his ear to listen also. But he could hear little
  7281	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsave the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords
  7282	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstruck on the piano and a few notes of a man’s voice singing.
  7283	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7284	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that
  7285	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe voice was singing and gazing up at his wife. There was grace and
  7286	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something. He asked
  7287	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening
  7288	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto distant music, a symbol of. If he were a painter he would paint her
  7289	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin that attitude. Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her
  7290	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show
  7291	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff the light ones. _Distant Music_ he would call the picture if he were
  7292	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta painter.
  7293	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7294	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came
  7295	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown the hall, still laughing.
  7296	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7297	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, isn’t Freddy terrible?” said Mary Jane. “He’s really terrible.”
  7298	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7299	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife
  7300	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano
  7301	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for them to be
  7302	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent. The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer
  7303	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice. The voice,
  7304	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade plaintive by distance and by the singer’s hoarseness, faintly
  7305	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tilluminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:
  7306	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7307	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7308	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO, the rain falls on my heavy locks And the dew wets my skin, My babe
  7309	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlies cold....
  7310	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7311	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O,” exclaimed Mary Jane. “It’s Bartell D’Arcy singing and he wouldn’t
  7312	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsing all the night. O, I’ll get him to sing a song before he goes.”
  7313	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7314	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O do, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate.
  7315	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7316	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before
  7317	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly.
  7318	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7319	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, what a pity!” she cried. “Is he coming down, Gretta?”
  7320	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7321	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them. A
  7322	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfew steps behind her were Mr Bartell D’Arcy and Miss O’Callaghan.
  7323	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7324	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Mr D’Arcy,” cried Mary Jane, “it’s downright mean of you to break
  7325	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.”
  7326	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7327	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I have been at him all the evening,” said Miss O’Callaghan, “and Mrs
  7328	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConroy too and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldn’t sing.”
  7329	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7330	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Mr D’Arcy,” said Aunt Kate, “now that was a great fib to tell.”
  7331	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7332	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Can’t you see that I’m as hoarse as a crow?” said Mr D’Arcy roughly.
  7333	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7334	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others,
  7335	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate
  7336	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr
  7337	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tD’Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning.
  7338	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7339	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s the weather,” said Aunt Julia, after a pause.
  7340	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7341	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, everybody has colds,” said Aunt Kate readily, “everybody.”
  7342	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7343	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They say,” said Mary Jane, “we haven’t had snow like it for thirty
  7344	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyears; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is
  7345	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgeneral all over Ireland.”
  7346	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7347	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I love the look of snow,” said Aunt Julia sadly.
  7348	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7349	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So do I,” said Miss O’Callaghan. “I think Christmas is never really
  7350	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChristmas unless we have the snow on the ground.”
  7351	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7352	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But poor Mr D’Arcy doesn’t like the snow,” said Aunt Kate, smiling.
  7353	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7354	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr D’Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a
  7355	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepentant tone told them the history of his cold. Everyone gave him
  7356	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of
  7357	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this throat in the night air. Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join
  7358	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and
  7359	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had
  7360	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseen her drying at the fire a few days before. She was in the same
  7361	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her. At last she turned
  7362	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and
  7363	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his
  7364	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart.
  7365	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7366	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr D’Arcy,” she said, “what is the name of that song you were singing?”
  7367	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7368	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s called _The Lass of Aughrim_,” said Mr D’Arcy, “but I couldn’t
  7369	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremember it properly. Why? Do you know it?”
  7370	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7371	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_The Lass of Aughrim_,” she repeated. “I couldn’t think of the name.”
  7372	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7373	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s a very nice air,” said Mary Jane. “I’m sorry you were not in voice
  7374	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttonight.”
  7375	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7376	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate, “don’t annoy Mr D’Arcy. I won’t have
  7377	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim annoyed.”
  7378	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7379	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSeeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door,
  7380	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere good-night was said:
  7381	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7382	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.”
  7383	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7384	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!”
  7385	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7386	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Good-night, Aunt
  7387	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia.”
  7388	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7389	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, good-night, Gretta, I didn’t see you.”
  7390	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7391	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Mr D’Arcy. Good-night, Miss O’Callaghan.”
  7392	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7393	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Miss Morkan.”
  7394	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7395	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, again.”
  7396	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7397	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, all. Safe home.”
  7398	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7399	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night. Good-night.”
  7400	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7401	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe morning was still dark. A dull yellow light brooded over the houses
  7402	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the river; and the sky seemed to be descending. It was slushy
  7403	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on
  7404	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe parapets of the quay and on the area railings. The lamps were still
  7405	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tburning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the
  7406	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFour Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky.
  7407	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7408	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was walking on before him with Mr Bartell D’Arcy, her shoes in a
  7409	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up
  7410	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude but Gabriel’s
  7411	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along his
  7412	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tveins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud, joyful,
  7413	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttender, valorous.
  7414	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7415	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to
  7416	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trun after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something
  7417	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfoolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that
  7418	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her.
  7419	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMoments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory.
  7420	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he was
  7421	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the ivy and the
  7422	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could not
  7423	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teat for happiness. They were standing on the crowded platform and he was
  7424	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplacing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove. He was standing
  7425	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith her in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a man making
  7426	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottles in a roaring furnace. It was very cold. Her face, fragrant in
  7427	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he called out to the
  7428	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman at the furnace:
  7429	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7430	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is the fire hot, sir?”
  7431	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7432	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was just as
  7433	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell. He might have answered rudely.
  7434	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7435	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing
  7436	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin warm flood along his arteries. Like the tender fire of stars moments
  7437	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of, broke
  7438	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon and illumined his memory. He longed to recall to her those moments,
  7439	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto make her forget the years of their dull existence together and
  7440	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremember only their moments of ecstasy. For the years, he felt, had not
  7441	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquenched his soul or hers. Their children, his writing, her household
  7442	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcares had not quenched all their souls’ tender fire. In one letter that
  7443	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had written to her then he had said: “Why is it that words like
  7444	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese seem to me so dull and cold? Is it because there is no word tender
  7445	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenough to be your name?”
  7446	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7447	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLike distant music these words that he had written years before were
  7448	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tborne towards him from the past. He longed to be alone with her. When
  7449	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe others had gone away, when he and she were in their room in the
  7450	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thotel, then they would be alone together. He would call her softly:
  7451	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7452	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta!”
  7453	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7454	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPerhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing. Then
  7455	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething in his voice would strike her. She would turn and look at
  7456	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim....
  7457	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7458	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad of its
  7459	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trattling noise as it saved him from conversation. She was looking out of
  7460	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a few words, pointing
  7461	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout some building or street. The horse galloped along wearily under the
  7462	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmurky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his heels,
  7463	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Gabriel was again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the boat,
  7464	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgalloping to their honeymoon.
  7465	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7466	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the cab drove across O’Connell Bridge Miss O’Callaghan said:
  7467	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7468	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They say you never cross O’Connell Bridge without seeing a white
  7469	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorse.”
  7470	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7471	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I see a white man this time,” said Gabriel.
  7472	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7473	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where?” asked Mr Bartell D’Arcy.
  7474	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7475	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he
  7476	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnodded familiarly to it and waved his hand.
  7477	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7478	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Dan,” he said gaily.
  7479	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7480	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite
  7481	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Mr Bartell D’Arcy’s protest, paid the driver. He gave the man a
  7482	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshilling over his fare. The man saluted and said:
  7483	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7484	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A prosperous New Year to you, sir.”
  7485	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7486	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The same to you,” said Gabriel cordially.
  7487	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7488	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while
  7489	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstanding at the curbstone, bidding the others good-night. She leaned
  7490	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced with him a few
  7491	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thours before. He had felt proud and happy then, happy that she was his,
  7492	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproud of her grace and wifely carriage. But now, after the kindling
  7493	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain of so many memories, the first touch of her body, musical and
  7494	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrange and perfumed, sent through him a keen pang of lust. Under cover
  7495	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side; and, as they
  7496	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood at the hotel door, he felt that they had escaped from their lives
  7497	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with
  7498	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twild and radiant hearts to a new adventure.
  7499	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7500	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAn old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall. He lit a
  7501	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They followed
  7502	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted
  7503	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in
  7504	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt
  7505	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttightly about her. He could have flung his arms about her hips and held
  7506	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only
  7507	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild
  7508	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpulse of his body in check. The porter halted on the stairs to settle
  7509	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this guttering candle. They halted too on the steps below him. In the
  7510	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray
  7511	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.
  7512	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7513	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his
  7514	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were
  7515	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be called in the morning.
  7516	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7517	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Eight,” said Gabriel.
  7518	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7519	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered
  7520	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapology but Gabriel cut him short.
  7521	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7522	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We don’t want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I
  7523	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay,” he added, pointing to the candle, “you might remove that handsome
  7524	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarticle, like a good man.”
  7525	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7526	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe porter took up his candle again, but slowly for he was surprised by
  7527	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went out. Gabriel shot
  7528	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lock to.
  7529	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7530	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA ghostly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window
  7531	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed
  7532	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order
  7533	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat his emotion might calm a little. Then he turned and leaned against
  7534	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken off her hat
  7535	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her
  7536	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and then said:
  7537	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7538	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta!”
  7539	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7540	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of
  7541	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlight towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary that the words
  7542	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould not pass Gabriel’s lips. No, it was not the moment yet.
  7543	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7544	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You looked tired,” he said.
  7545	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7546	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I am a little,” she answered.
  7547	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7548	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You don’t feel ill or weak?”
  7549	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7550	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, tired: that’s all.”
  7551	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7552	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited
  7553	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he
  7554	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid abruptly:
  7555	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7556	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“By the way, Gretta!”
  7557	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7558	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is it?”
  7559	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7560	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You know that poor fellow Malins?” he said quickly.
  7561	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7562	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. What about him?”
  7563	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7564	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, poor fellow, he’s a decent sort of chap after all,” continued
  7565	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel in a false voice. “He gave me back that sovereign I lent him,
  7566	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand I didn’t expect it, really. It’s a pity he wouldn’t keep away from
  7567	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat Browne, because he’s not a bad fellow, really.”
  7568	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7569	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He
  7570	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something?
  7571	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIf she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take
  7572	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes
  7573	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst. He longed to be master of her strange mood.
  7574	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7575	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“When did you lend him the pound?” she asked, after a pause.
  7576	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7577	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal
  7578	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanguage about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her
  7579	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he
  7580	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
  7581	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7582	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in
  7583	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHenry Street.”
  7584	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7585	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come
  7586	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the window. She stood before him for an instant, looking at him
  7587	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her
  7588	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him.
  7589	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7590	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You are a very generous person, Gabriel,” she said.
  7591	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7592	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness
  7593	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back,
  7594	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it fine and
  7595	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrilliant. His heart was brimming over with happiness. Just when he
  7596	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord. Perhaps her
  7597	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthoughts had been running with his. Perhaps she had felt the impetuous
  7598	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdesire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had come upon her.
  7599	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered why he had been so
  7600	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiffident.
  7601	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7602	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm
  7603	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly:
  7604	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7605	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?”
  7606	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7607	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again, softly:
  7608	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7609	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter. Do I
  7610	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow?”
  7611	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7612	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of tears:
  7613	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7614	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I am thinking about that song, _The Lass of Aughrim_.”
  7615	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7616	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms
  7617	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stock-still for a
  7618	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way of
  7619	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad,
  7620	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him
  7621	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he saw it in a mirror and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He
  7622	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalted a few paces from her and said:
  7623	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7624	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What about the song? Why does that make you cry?”
  7625	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7626	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of
  7627	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended went into his
  7628	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice.
  7629	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7630	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why, Gretta?” he asked.
  7631	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7632	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.”
  7633	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7634	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And who was the person long ago?” asked Gabriel, smiling.
  7635	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7636	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my
  7637	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrandmother,” she said.
  7638	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7639	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe smile passed away from Gabriel’s face. A dull anger began to gather
  7640	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to
  7641	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglow angrily in his veins.
  7642	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7643	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Someone you were in love with?” he asked ironically.
  7644	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7645	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was a young boy I used to know,” she answered, “named Michael Furey.
  7646	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe used to sing that song, _The Lass of Aughrim_. He was very delicate.”
  7647	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7648	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested
  7649	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin this delicate boy.
  7650	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7651	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I can see him so plainly,” she said after a moment. “Such eyes as he
  7652	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them--an expression!”
  7653	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7654	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O then, you were in love with him?” said Gabriel.
  7655	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7656	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I used to go out walking with him,” she said, “when I was in Galway.”
  7657	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7658	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA thought flew across Gabriel’s mind.
  7659	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7660	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?”
  7661	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t he said coldly.
  7662	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7663	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe looked at him and asked in surprise:
  7664	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7665	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What for?”
  7666	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7667	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said:
  7668	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7669	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How do I know? To see him, perhaps.”
  7670	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7671	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in
  7672	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilence.
  7673	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7674	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He is dead,” she said at length. “He died when he was only seventeen.
  7675	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIsn’t it a terrible thing to die so young as that?”
  7676	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7677	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What was he?” asked Gabriel, still ironically.
  7678	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7679	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He was in the gasworks,” she said.
  7680	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7681	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation
  7682	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been
  7683	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and
  7684	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjoy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A
  7685	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself
  7686	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous,
  7687	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his
  7688	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\town clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse
  7689	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light
  7690	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead.
  7691	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7692	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when
  7693	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the spoke was humble and indifferent.
  7694	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7695	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,” he said.
  7696	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7697	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was great with him at that time,” she said.
  7698	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7699	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be
  7700	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands
  7701	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand said, also sadly:
  7702	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7703	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?”
  7704	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7705	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I think he died for me,” she answered.
  7706	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7707	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer as if, at that hour when
  7708	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming
  7709	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst him, gathering forces against him in its vague world. But he
  7710	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to
  7711	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaress her hand. He did not question her again for he felt that she
  7712	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould tell him of herself. Her hand was warm and moist: it did not
  7713	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trespond to his touch but he continued to caress it just as he had
  7714	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaressed her first letter to him that spring morning.
  7715	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7716	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was in the winter,” she said, “about the beginning of the winter
  7717	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen I was going to leave my grandmother’s and come up here to the
  7718	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconvent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and
  7719	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldn’t be let out and his people in Oughterard were written to. He was
  7720	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly.”
  7721	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7722	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe paused for a moment and sighed.
  7723	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7724	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Poor fellow,” she said. “He was very fond of me and he was such a
  7725	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like
  7726	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only for
  7727	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.”
  7728	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7729	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well; and then?” asked Gabriel.
  7730	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7731	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to
  7732	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe convent he was much worse and I wouldn’t be let see him so I wrote
  7733	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the
  7734	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsummer and hoping he would be better then.”
  7735	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7736	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went on:
  7737	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7738	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Then the night before I left I was in my grandmother’s house in Nuns’
  7739	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIsland, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window.
  7740	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe window was so wet I couldn’t see so I ran downstairs as I was and
  7741	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at
  7742	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe end of the garden, shivering.”
  7743	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7744	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And did you not tell him to go back?” asked Gabriel.
  7745	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7746	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his
  7747	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeath in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his
  7748	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there
  7749	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a tree.”
  7750	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7751	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And did he go home?” asked Gabriel.
  7752	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7753	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died
  7754	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he was buried in Oughterard where his people came from. O, the day I
  7755	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theard that, that he was dead!”
  7756	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7757	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stopped, choking with sobs and, overcome by emotion, flung herself
  7758	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand
  7759	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her
  7760	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.
  7761	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7762	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was fast asleep.
  7763	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7764	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully
  7765	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn
  7766	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her
  7767	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband,
  7768	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad played in her life. He watched her while she slept as though he and
  7769	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe had never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested
  7770	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must
  7771	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange,
  7772	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to say even to
  7773	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself that her face was no longer beautiful but he knew that it was no
  7774	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlonger the face for which Michael Furey had braved death.
  7775	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7776	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPerhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the
  7777	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A petticoat string
  7778	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen
  7779	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He wondered at his riot of
  7780	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\temotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt’s
  7781	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the
  7782	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmerry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the
  7783	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalk along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon
  7784	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse. He had
  7785	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing
  7786	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Arrayed for the Bridal_. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that
  7787	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The
  7788	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him,
  7789	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would
  7790	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would
  7791	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfind only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very soon.
  7792	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7793	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself
  7794	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by
  7795	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other
  7796	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally
  7797	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her
  7798	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart for so many years that image of her lover’s eyes when he had told
  7799	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther that he did not wish to live.
  7800	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7801	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGenerous tears filled Gabriel’s eyes. He had never felt like that
  7802	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love.
  7803	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness
  7804	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping
  7805	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where
  7806	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not
  7807	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapprehend, their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity was
  7808	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself
  7809	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich these dead had one time reared and lived in was dissolving and
  7810	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdwindling.
  7811	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7812	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun
  7813	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling
  7814	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on
  7815	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general
  7816	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central
  7817	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and,
  7818	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfarther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves.
  7819	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the
  7820	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the
  7821	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on
  7822	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling
  7823	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of
  7824	DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir last end, upon all the living and the dead.
