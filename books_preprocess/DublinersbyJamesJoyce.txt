DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHERE was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto me: “I am not long for this world,” and I had thought his words idle.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsimony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOld Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto supper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treturning to some former remark of his:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, I wouldn’t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer ...
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was something uncanny about him. I’ll tell you my opinion....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he used to be rather
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinteresting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand his endless stories about the distillery.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I have my own theory about it,” he said. “I think it was one of those
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t... peculiar cases.... But it’s hard to say....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory. My
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncle saw me staring and said to me:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, so your old friend is gone, you’ll be sorry to hear.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who?” said I.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Father Flynn.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is he dead?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the house.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the news
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad not interested me. My uncle explained to old Cotter.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap taught him a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreat deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God have mercy on his soul,” said my aunt piously.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOld Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little beady black
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplate. He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wouldn’t like children of mine,” he said, “to have too much to say to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta man like that.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How do you mean, Mr Cotter?” asked my aunt.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What I mean is,” said old Cotter, “it’s bad for children. My idea is:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlet a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot be.... Am I right, Jack?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s my principle, too,” said my uncle. “Let him learn to box his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorner. That’s what I’m always saying to that Rosicrucian there: take
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a cold
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbath, winter and summer. And that’s what stands to me now. Education
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis all very fine and large.... Mr Cotter might take a pick of that leg
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmutton,” he added to my aunt.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no, not for me,” said old Cotter.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But why do you think it’s not good for children, Mr Cotter?” she asked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s bad for children,” said old Cotter, “because their minds are so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpressionable. When children see things like that, you know, it has an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teffect....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanger. Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe heavy grey face of the paralytic. I drew the blankets over my head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmurmured; and I understood that it desired to confess something. I felt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and there again
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a murmuring
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his sin.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little house
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop, registered under
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe vague name of _Drapery_. The drapery consisted mainly of children’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twindow, saying: _Umbrellas Re-covered_. No notice was visible now for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the door-knocker with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the crape. I also approached and read:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJuly 1st, 1895 The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine’s Church,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMeath Street), aged sixty-five years. _R. I. P._
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I would have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his great-coat. Perhaps
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpresent would have roused him from his stupefied doze. It was always I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of his coat.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpriestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a week, with which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite inefficacious.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock. I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe theatrical advertisements in the shopwindows as I went. I found it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teven annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal. He had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstudied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLatin properly. He had told me stories about the catacombs and about
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNapoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifferent ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquestions to me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timperfections. His questions showed me how complex and mysterious were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcertain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChurch had written books as thick as the _Post Office Directory_ and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese intricate questions. Often when I thought of this I could make
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto smile and nod his head twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately. When he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlie upon his lower lip--a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter’s words and tried
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. I remembered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfashion. I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcustoms were strange--in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe end of the dream.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds. Nannie
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treceived us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all. The old woman
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt’s nodding, proceeded to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabove the level of the banister-rail. At the first landing she stopped
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead-room. My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthin flames. He had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we three
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknelt down at the foot of the bed. I pretended to pray but I could not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgather my thoughts because the old woman’s mutterings distracted me. I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the heels
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side. The fancy came to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taltar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice. His face was very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttruculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room--the flowers.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfound Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I groped my way towards my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tusual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and brought
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses. She set these on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable and invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsister’s bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeclined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke: we all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgazed at the empty fireplace.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well, he’s gone to a better world.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt fingered the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstem of her wine-glass before sipping a little.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did he ... peacefully?” she asked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Oh, quite peacefully, ma’am,” said Eliza. “You couldn’t tell when the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath went out of him. He had a beautiful death, God be praised.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And everything...?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Father O’Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and prepared
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim and all.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He knew then?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He was quite resigned.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He looks quite resigned,” said my aunt.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s what the woman we had in to wash him said. She said he just
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and resigned. No one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould think he’d make such a beautiful corpse.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, indeed,” said my aunt.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe sipped a little more from her glass and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow that you did all you could for him. You were both very kind to him,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI must say.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza smoothed her dress over her knees.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, poor James!” she said. “God knows we done all we could, as poor as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe are--we wouldn’t see him want anything while he was in it.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfall asleep.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s poor Nannie,” said Eliza, looking at her, “she’s wore out. All
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash him and then
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe chapel. Only for Father O’Rourke I don’t know what we’d have done
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat all. It was him brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the _Freeman’s General_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor James’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinsurance.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Wasn’t that good of him?” said my aunt.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, there’s no friends like the old friends,” she said, “when all is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid and done, no friends that a body can trust.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Indeed, that’s true,” said my aunt. “And I’m sure now that he’s gone to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this eternal reward he won’t forget you and all your kindness to him.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, poor James!” said Eliza. “He was no great trouble to us. You
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldn’t hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I know he’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone and all to that....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s when it’s all over that you’ll miss him,” said my aunt.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know that,” said Eliza. “I won’t be bringing him in his cup of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeef-tea any more, nor you, ma’am, sending him his snuff. Ah, poor
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJames!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrewdly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him latterly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhenever I’d bring in his soup to him there I’d find him with his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his mouth
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topen.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she continued:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the’d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. If we could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that makes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno noise that Father O’Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twheels, for the day cheap--he said, at Johnny Rush’s over the way there
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening. He had his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmind set on that.... Poor James!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Lord have mercy on his soul!” said my aunt.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it. Then she put
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some time
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithout speaking.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He was too scrupulous always,” she said. “The duties of the priesthood
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas too much for him. And then his life was, you might say, crossed.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said my aunt. “He was a disappointed man. You could see that.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapproached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy chair in the corner. Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe waited respectfully for her to break the silence: and after a long
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpause she said slowly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it. Of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut still.... They say it was the boy’s fault. But poor James was so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnervous, God be merciful to him!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And was that it?” said my aunt. “I heard something....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza nodded.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That affected his mind,” she said. “After that he began to mope by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself. So one night
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn’t find him anywhere.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey looked high up and low down; and still they couldn’t see a sight
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof him anywhere. So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook for him.... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoftly to himself?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened; but there was no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this coffin as we had seen him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchalice on his breast.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEliza resumed:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself.... So then, of course, when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith him....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAN ENCOUNTER
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIT was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlibrary made up of old numbers of _The Union Jack_, _Pluck_ and _The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHalfpenny Marvel_. Every evening after school we met in his back garden
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother Leo, the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tidler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor we fought a pitched battle on the grass. But, however well we fought,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe Dillon’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twar dance of victory. His parents went to eight-o’clock mass every
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs Dillon was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprevalent in the hall of the house. But he played too fiercely for us
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho were younger and more timid. He looked like some kind of an Indian
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head, beating a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttin with his fist and yelling:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ya! yaka, yaka, yaka!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe priesthood. Nevertheless it was true.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfluence, differences of culture and constitution were waived. We
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbanded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some almost in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfear: and of the number of these latter, the reluctant Indians who
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness, I was one. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadventures related in the literature of the Wild West were remote from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy nature but, at least, they opened doors of escape. I liked better
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome American detective stories which were traversed from time to time
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby unkempt fierce and beautiful girls. Though there was nothing wrong
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey were circulated secretly at school. One day when Father Butler was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thearing the four pages of Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was discovered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a copy of _The Halfpenny Marvel_.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“This page or this page? This page? Now, Dillon, up! _‘Hardly had the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tday’...._ Go on! What day? _‘Hardly had the day dawned’...._ Have you
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstudied it? What have you there in your pocket?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone’s heart palpitated as Leo Dillon handed up the paper and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teveryone assumed an innocent face. Father Butler turned over the pages,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrowning.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is this rubbish?” he said. “_The Apache Chief!_ Is this what you
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tread instead of studying your Roman History? Let me not find any more
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof this wretched stuff in this college. The man who wrote it, I suppose,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas some wretched fellow who writes these things for a drink. I’m
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsurprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff. I could
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderstand it if you were ... National School boys. Now, Dillon, I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvise you strongly, get at your work or....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Wild West for me and the confused puffy face of Leo Dillon awakened
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone of my consciences. But when the restraining influence of the school
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas at a distance I began to hunger again for wild sensations, for the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tescape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troutine of school in the morning because I wanted real adventures to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thappen to myself. But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople who remain at home: they must be sought abroad.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the weariness of school-life for one day at least. With Leo
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day’s miching. Each of us
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaved up sixpence. We were to meet at ten in the morning on the Canal
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBridge. Mahony’s big sister was to write an excuse for him and Leo
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick. We arranged to go
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House. Leo Dillon was afraid
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe might meet Father Butler or someone out of the college; but Mahony
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked, very sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPigeon House. We were reassured: and I brought the first stage of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame time showing them my own sixpence. When we were making the last
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited. We shook hands,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing, and Mahony said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Till tomorrow, mates!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat night I slept badly. In the morning I was first-comer to the bridge
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas I lived nearest. I hid my books in the long grass near the ashpit at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried along the canal
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbank. It was a mild sunny morning in the first week of June. I sat up
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas shoes which I had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the docile horses pulling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta tramload of business people up the hill. All the branches of the tall
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sunlight slanted through them on to the water. The granite stone of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bridge was beginning to be warm and I began to pat it with my hands
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin time to an air in my head. I was very happy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen I had been sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw Mahony’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrey suit approaching. He came up the hill, smiling, and clambered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup beside me on the bridge. While we were waiting he brought out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe catapult which bulged from his inner pocket and explained some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timprovements which he had made in it. I asked him why he had brought it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he told me he had brought it to have some gas with the birds. Mahony
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser. We waited
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of Leo
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDillon. Mahony, at last, jumped down and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come along. I knew Fatty’d funk it.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And his sixpence...?” I said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s forfeit,” said Mahony. “And so much the better for us--a bob and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta tanner instead of a bob.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the Vitriol Works
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand then turned to the right along the Wharf Road. Mahony began to play
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Indian as soon as we were out of public sight. He chased a crowd
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof ragged girls, brandishing his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshould charge them. I objected that the boys were too small and so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe walked on, the ragged troop screaming after us: _“Swaddlers!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSwaddlers!”_ thinking that we were Protestants because Mahony, who was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailure because you must have at least three. We revenged ourselves on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeo Dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget at three o’clock from Mr Ryan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe came then near the river. We spent a long time walking about the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoisy streets flanked by high stone walls, watching the working of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrivers of groaning carts. It was noon when we reached the quays and, as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches, we bought two big
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurrant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\triver. We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of Dublin’s commerce--the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbarges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke, the brown
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white sailing-vessel which was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing discharged on the opposite quay. Mahony said it would be right
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tskit to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even I, looking at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe high masts, saw, or imagined, the geography which had been scantily
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes. School
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twane.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe crossed the Liffey in the ferryboat, paying our toll to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttransported in the company of two labourers and a little Jew with a bag.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe were serious to the point of solemnity, but once during the short
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoyage our eyes met and we laughed. When we landed we watched the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdischarging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed from the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother quay. Some bystander said that she was a Norwegian vessel. I went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but, failing to do
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso, I came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of them
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreen eyes for I had some confused notion.... The sailors’ eyes were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblue and grey and even black. The only sailor whose eyes could have been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalled green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay by calling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout cheerfully every time the planks fell:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All right! All right!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into Ringsend. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tday had grown sultry, and in the windows of the grocers’ shops musty
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbiscuits lay bleaching. We bought some biscuits and chocolate which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamilies of the fishermen live. We could find no dairy and so we went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto a huckster’s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRefreshed by this, Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto a wide field. We both felt rather tired and when we reached the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfield we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould see the Dodder.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvisiting the Pigeon House. We had to be home before four o’clock lest
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour adventure should be discovered. Mahony looked regretfully at his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcatapult and I had to suggest going home by train before he regained
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany cheerfulness. The sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was nobody but ourselves in the field. When we had lain on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbank for some time without speaking I saw a man approaching from the far
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tend of the field. I watched him lazily as I chewed one of those green
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstems on which girls tell fortunes. He came along by the bank slowly. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked with one hand upon his hip and in the other hand he held a stick
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith which he tapped the turf lightly. He was shabbily dressed in a suit
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof greenish-black and wore what we used to call a jerry hat with a high
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrown. He seemed to be fairly old for his moustache was ashen-grey. When
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the passed at our feet he glanced up at us quickly and then continued his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway. We followed him with our eyes and saw that when he had gone on for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps fifty paces he turned about and began to retrace his steps. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked towards us very slowly, always tapping the ground with his stick,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso slowly that I thought he was looking for something in the grass.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stopped when he came level with us and bade us good-day. We answered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with great care.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to talk of the weather, saying that it would be a very hot
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsummer and adding that the seasons had changed greatly since he was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboy--a long time ago. He said that the happiest time of one’s life was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tundoubtedly one’s school-boy days and that he would give anything to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung again. While he expressed these sentiments which bored us a little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe kept silent. Then he began to talk of school and of books. He asked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus whether we had read the poetry of Thomas Moore or the works of Sir
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWalter Scott and Lord Lytton. I pretended that I had read every book he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmentioned so that in the end he said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, I can see you are a bookworm like myself. Now,” he added, pointing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, “he is different; he goes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin for games.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe said he had all Sir Walter Scott’s works and all Lord Lytton’s works
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat home and never tired of reading them. “Of course,” he said, “there
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere some of Lord Lytton’s works which boys couldn’t read.” Mahony asked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhy couldn’t boys read them--a question which agitated and pained me
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause I was afraid the man would think I was as stupid as Mahony. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman, however, only smiled. I saw that he had great gaps in his mouth
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween his yellow teeth. Then he asked us which of us had the most
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsweethearts. Mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties. The man
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked me how many had I. I answered that I had none. He did not believe
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme and said he was sure I must have one. I was silent.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell us,” said Mahony pertly to the man, “how many have you yourself?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof sweethearts.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Every boy,” he said, “has a little sweetheart.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his age. In my heart I thought that what he said about boys and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsweethearts was reasonable. But I disliked the words in his mouth and I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or felt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta sudden chill. As he proceeded I noticed that his accent was good. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair they had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so good as they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to be if one only knew. There was nothing he liked, he said, so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuch as looking at a nice young girl, at her nice white hands and her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeautiful soft hair. He gave me the impression that he was repeating
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething which he had learned by heart or that, magnetised by some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twords of his own speech, his mind was slowly circling round and round in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe same orbit. At times he spoke as if he were simply alluding to some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfact that everybody knew, and at times he lowered his voice and spoke
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmysteriously as if he were telling us something secret which he did not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twish others to overhear. He repeated his phrases over and over again,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvarying them and surrounding them with his monotonous voice. I continued
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto gaze towards the foot of the slope, listening to him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a long while his monologue paused. He stood up slowly, saying
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he had to leave us for a minute or so, a few minutes, and, without
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchanging the direction of my gaze, I saw him walking slowly away from us
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the near end of the field. We remained silent when he had gone.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a silence of a few minutes I heard Mahony exclaim:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I say! Look what he’s doing!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs I neither answered nor raised my eyes Mahony exclaimed again:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I say.... He’s a queer old josser!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“In case he asks us for our names,” I said, “let you be Murphy and I’ll
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe Smith.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe said nothing further to each other. I was still considering whether
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain. Hardly had he sat down when Mahony, catching sight of the cat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich had escaped him, sprang up and pursued her across the field. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman and I watched the chase. The cat escaped once more and Mahony began
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto throw stones at the wall she had escaladed. Desisting from this, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to wander about the far end of the field, aimlessly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter an interval the man spoke to me. He said that my friend was a very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school. I was going to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treply indignantly that we were not National School boys to be whipped,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he called it; but I remained silent. He began to speak on the subject
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof chastising boys. His mind, as if magnetised again by his speech,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre. He said that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen boys were that kind they ought to be whipped and well whipped. When
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him any good but a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood sound whipping. A slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping. I was surprised at this
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his face. As I did so I met
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me from under a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwitching forehead. I turned my eyes away again.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man continued his monologue. He seemed to have forgotten his recent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliberalism. He said that if ever he found a boy talking to girls or
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaving a girl for a sweetheart he would whip him and whip him; and that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould teach him not to be talking to girls. And if a boy had a girl
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta whipping as no boy ever got in this world. He said that there was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing in this world he would like so well as that. He described to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmystery. He would love that, he said, better than anything in this
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld; and his voice, as he led me monotonously through the mystery,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I should
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderstand him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up abruptly. Lest
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to fix
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go, I bade him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood-day. I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith fear that he would seize me by the ankles. When I reached the top
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the slope I turned round and, without looking at him, called loudly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross the field:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Murphy!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaltry stratagem. I had to call the name again before Mahony saw me
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand hallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running across the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfield to me! He ran as if to bring me aid. And I was penitent; for in my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart I had always despised him a little.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tARABY
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNORTH RICHMOND STREET, being blind, was a quiet street except at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hour when the Christian Brothers’ School set the boys free. An
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timperturbable faces.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuseless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof which were curled and damp: _The Abbot_, by Walter Scott, _The Devout
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCommunicant_ and _The Memoirs of Vidocq_. I liked the last best because
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcentral apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI found the late tenant’s rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the furniture of his house to his sister.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspace of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\todours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tharness. When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea we watched
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshadow and walked up to Mangan’s steps resignedly. She was waiting
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her hair tossed from side to side.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome of the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs’
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a _come-all-you_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout O’Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tland. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmyself did not understand. My eyes were often full of tears (I could not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttell why) and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto my bosom. I thought little of the future. I did not know whether I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp and her words
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdied. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThrough one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds. Some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy hands together until they trembled, murmuring: _“O love! O love!”_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmany times.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoing to _Araby_. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsplendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And why can’t you?” I asked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaps and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfalling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood at ease.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s well for you,” she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If I go,” I said, “I will bring you something.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tread. The syllables of the word _Araby_ were called to me through the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas surprised and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I answered few
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquestions in class. I watched my master’s face pass from amiability to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with the serious
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twork of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto me child’s play, ugly monotonous child’s play.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\that-brush, and answered me curtly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, boy, I know.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe window. I left the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tearly. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgained the upper part of the house. The high cold empty gloomy rooms
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker’s widow, who collected
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn’t wait any
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlonger, but it was after eight o’clock and she did not like to be out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlate as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to walk
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the halldoor. I heard him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmidway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbazaar. He had forgotten.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Can’t you give him the money and let him go? You’ve kept him late
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenough as it is.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe old saying: “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” He asked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme where I was going and, when I had told him a second time he asked me
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid I know _The Arab’s Farewell to his Steed_. When I left the kitchen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After an intolerable
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\truinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar. I remained
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timprovised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a large building which displayed the magical name.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girdled at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalf its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreater part of the hall was in darkness. I recognised a silence like
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the centre
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere still open. Before a curtain, over which the words _Café Chantant_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI listened to the fall of the coins.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRemembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to one of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentlemen. I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir conversation.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I never said such a thing!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, but you did!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, but I didn’t!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Didn’t she say that?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. I heard her.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, there’s a ... fib!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tObserving me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stall and murmured:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, thank you.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe young lady glanced at me over her shoulder.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tend of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas now completely dark.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tderided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEVELINE
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSHE sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof dusty cretonne. She was tired.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFew people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime there used to be a field there in which they used to play every
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening with other people’s children. Then a man from Belfast bought
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe field and built houses in it--not like their little brown houses but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto play together in that field--the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thowever, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEngland. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers, to leave her home.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHome! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tearth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again those
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamiliar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpriest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tharmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMargaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her father.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit with a casual word:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He is in Melbourne now.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttried to weigh each side of the question. In her home anyway she had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther. Of course she had to work hard, both in the house and at business.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad run away with a fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistening.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Hill, don’t you see these ladies are waiting?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Look lively, Miss Hill, please.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat. Then she would be married--she, Eveline. People would treat her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been. Even
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her father’s violence. She knew it was that that had given her the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpalpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for her like
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl; but latterly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther dead mother’s sake. And now she had nobody to protect her. Ernest
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnearly always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsquabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunspeakably. She always gave her entire wages--seven shillings--and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHarry always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom her father. He said she used to squander the money, that she had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno head, that he wasn’t going to give her his hard-earned money to throw
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad of a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaturday night. In the end he would give her the money and ask her had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe any intention of buying Sunday’s dinner. Then she had to rush out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpurse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treturning home late under her load of provisions. She had hard work to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkeep the house together and to see that the two young children who had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tregularly. It was hard work--a hard life--but now that she was about to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him by the night-boat to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaiting for her. How well she remembered the first time she had seen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt seemed a few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a face of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbronze. Then they had come to know each other. He used to meet her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutside the Stores every evening and see her home. He took her to see
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_The Bohemian Girl_ and she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpart of the theatre with him. He was awfully fond of music and sang a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle. People knew that they were courting and, when he sang about the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlass that loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly confused. He used
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him. He had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttales of distant countries. He had started as a deck boy at a pound a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmonth on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada. He told her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tservices. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAyres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave anything to say to him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know these sailor chaps,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlover secretly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother’s bonnet to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmake the children laugh.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer time was running out but she continued to sit by the window,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night to remind
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas long as she could. She remembered the last night of her mother’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tillness; she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ-player
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She remembered her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather strutting back into the sickroom saying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Damned Italians! coming over here!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs she mused the pitiful vision of her mother’s life laid its spell on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe very quick of her being--that life of commonplace sacrifices closing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother’s voice
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaying constantly with foolish insistence:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to happiness.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He would save
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying something
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout the passage over and over again. The station was full of soldiers
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith brown baggages. Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her cheek pale
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God to direct
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a long mournful
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she would be on the sea
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbooked. Could she still draw back after all he had done for her? Her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent fervent prayer.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trailing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAmid the seas she sent a cry of anguish!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Eveline! Evvy!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was shouted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat to go on but he still called to her. She set her white face to him,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of love or
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfarewell or recognition.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAFTER THE RACE
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE cars came scudding in towards Dublin, running evenly like pellets
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the groove of the Naas Road. At the crest of the hill at Inchicore
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twealth and industry. Now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the gratefully oppressed. Their sympathy, however, was for the blue
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcars--the cars of their friends, the French.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe French, moreover, were virtual victors. Their team had finished
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsolidly; they had been placed second and third and the driver of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twinning German car was reported a Belgian. Each blue car, therefore,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treceived a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the car. In one of these trimly built cars was a party of four
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof successful Gallicism: in fact, these four young men were almost
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thilarious. They were Charles Ségouin, the owner of the car; André
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRivière, a young electrician of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVillona and a neatly groomed young man named Doyle. Ségouin was in good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thumour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance (he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas about to start a motor establishment in Paris) and Rivière was in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese two young men (who were cousins) were also in good humour because
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the success of the French cars. Villona was in good humour because he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides he was an optimist by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnature. The fourth member of the party, however, was too excited to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgenuinely happy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was about twenty-six years of age, with a soft, light brown moustache
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand rather innocent-looking grey eyes. His father, who had begun life as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan advanced Nationalist, had modified his views early. He had made his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney as a butcher in Kingstown and by opening shops in Dublin and in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe suburbs he had made his money many times over. He had also been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had become rich enough to be alluded to in the Dublin newspapers as a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmerchant prince. He had sent his son to England to be educated in a big
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCatholic college and had afterwards sent him to Dublin University to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstudy law. Jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a while. He had money and he was popular; and he divided his time
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcuriously between musical and motoring circles. Then he had been sent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a term to Cambridge to see a little life. His father, remonstrative,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut covertly proud of the excess, had paid his bills and brought him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome. It was at Cambridge that he had met Ségouin. They were not much
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore than acquaintances as yet but Jimmy found great pleasure in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsociety of one who had seen so much of the world and was reputed to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\town some of the biggest hotels in France. Such a person (as his father
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagreed) was well worth knowing, even if he had not been the charming
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompanion he was. Villona was entertaining also--a brilliant
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpianist--but, unfortunately, very poor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth. The two
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcousins sat on the front seat; Jimmy and his Hungarian friend sat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbehind. Decidedly Villona was in excellent spirits; he kept up a deep
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbass hum of melody for miles of the road. The Frenchmen flung their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughter and light words over their shoulders and often Jimmy had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto strain forward to catch the quick phrase. This was not altogether
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasant for him, as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBesides Villona’s humming would confuse anybody; the noise of the car,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRapid motion through space elates one; so does notoriety; so does
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe possession of money. These were three good reasons for Jimmy’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcitement. He had been seen by many of his friends that day in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompany of these Continentals. At the control Ségouin had presented him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto one of the French competitors and, in answer to his confused murmur
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof compliment, the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshining white teeth. It was pleasant after that honour to return to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprofane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks. Then
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas to money--he really had a great sum under his control. Ségouin,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps, would not think it a great sum but Jimmy who, in spite of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttemporary errors, was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell with what difficulty it had been got together. This knowledge had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpreviously kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, if he had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow much more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubstance! It was a serious thing for him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course, the investment was a good one and Ségouin had managed to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgive the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the mite of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIrish money was to be included in the capital of the concern. Jimmy had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta respect for his father’s shrewdness in business matters and in this
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase it had been his father who had first suggested the investment;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney to be made in the motor business, pots of money. Moreover Ségouin
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad the unmistakable air of wealth. Jimmy set out to translate into
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays’ work that lordly car in which he sat. How smoothly it ran. In what
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstyle they had come careering along the country roads! The journey
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmachinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswift blue animal.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey drove down Dame Street. The street was busy with unusual
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttraffic, loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram-drivers. Near the Bank Ségouin drew up and Jimmy and his friend
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talighted. A little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thomage to the snorting motor. The party was to dine together that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening in Ségouin’s hotel and, meanwhile, Jimmy and his friend, who
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas staying with him, were to go home to dress. The car steered out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslowly for Grafton Street while the two young men pushed their way
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the knot of gazers. They walked northward with a curious feeling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof disappointment in the exercise, while the city hung its pale globes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof light above them in a haze of summer evening.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn Jimmy’s house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion. A certain
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpride mingled with his parents’ trepidation, a certain eagerness, also,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleast this virtue. Jimmy, too, looked very well when he was dressed and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his dress
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttie, his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable. His father,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttherefore, was unusually friendly with Villona and his manner expressed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta real respect for foreign accomplishments; but this subtlety of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thost was probably lost upon the Hungarian, who was beginning to have a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsharp desire for his dinner.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe dinner was excellent, exquisite. Ségouin, Jimmy decided, had a very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trefined taste. The party was increased by a young Englishman named Routh
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhom Jimmy had seen with Ségouin at Cambridge. The young men supped in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta snug room lit by electric candle-lamps. They talked volubly and with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle reserve. Jimmy, whose imagination was kindling, conceived the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlively youth of the Frenchmen twined elegantly upon the firm framework
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Englishman’s manner. A graceful image of his, he thought, and a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust one. He admired the dexterity with which their host directed the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconversation. The five young men had various tastes and their tongues
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been loosened. Villona, with immense respect, began to discover to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe mildly surprised Englishman the beauties of the English madrigal,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeploring the loss of old instruments. Rivière, not wholly ingenuously,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tundertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the French mechanicians.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe resonant voice of the Hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe spurious lutes of the romantic painters when Ségouin shepherded
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this party into politics. Here was congenial ground for all. Jimmy, under
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgenerous influences, felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithin him: he aroused the torpid Routh at last. The room grew doubly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thot and Ségouin’s task grew harder each moment: there was even danger
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof personal spite. The alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Humanity and, when the toast had been drunk, he threw open a window
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsignificantly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrolled along Stephen’s Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparty.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“André.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s Farley!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell what the talk was about. Villona and Rivière were the noisiest,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd, blended now into
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the train at Westland
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRow and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he was an old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Fine night, sir!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing _Cadet
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRoussel_ in chorus, stamping their feet at every:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_“Ho! Ho! Hohé, vraiment!”_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconviction:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It is delightful!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Rivière, Farley acting as cavalier and Rivière as lady. Then
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmerriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleast. Then Farley got out of breath and cried _“Stop!”_ A man brought
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form’s sake.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrance, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong speech, Villona saying: _“Hear! hear!”_ whenever there was a pause.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must have been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta good speech. Farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly. What
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjovial fellows! What good company they were!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCards! cards! The table was cleared. Villona returned quietly to his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpiano and played voluntaries for them. The other men played game after
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgame, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure. They drank the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thealth of the Queen of Hearts and of the Queen of Diamonds. Jimmy felt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was flashing. Play ran very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh and paper began to pass. Jimmy did not know exactly who was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twinning but he knew that he was losing. But it was his own fault for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the frequently mistook his cards and the other men had to calculate his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI.O.U.’s for him. They were devils of fellows but he wished they would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstop: it was getting late. Someone gave the toast of the yacht _The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBelle of Newport_ and then someone proposed one great game for a finish.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe piano had stopped; Villona must have gone up on deck. It was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterrible game. They stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJimmy understood that the game lay between Routh and Ségouin. What
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcitement! Jimmy was excited too; he would lose, of course. How much
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad he written away? The men rose to their feet to play the last tricks.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking and gesticulating. Routh won. The cabin shook with the young
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmen’s cheering and the cards were bundled together. They began then to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgather in what they had won. Farley and Jimmy were the heaviest losers.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounting the beats of his temples. The cabin door opened and he saw the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHungarian standing in a shaft of grey light:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Daybreak, gentlemen!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTWO GALLANTS
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE grey warm evening of August had descended upon the city and a mild
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twarm air, a memory of summer, circulated in the streets. The streets,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed with a gaily coloured crowd.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLike illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their tall
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoles upon the living texture below which, changing shape and hue
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunceasingly, sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunceasing murmur.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. One of them was just
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbringing a long monologue to a close. The other, who walked on the verge
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road, owing to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this companion’s rudeness, wore an amused listening face. He was squat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand ruddy. A yachting cap was shoved far back from his forehead and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnarrative to which he listened made constant waves of expression break
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforth over his face from the corners of his nose and eyes and mouth.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle jets of wheezing laughter followed one another out of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconvulsed body. His eyes, twinkling with cunning enjoyment, glanced at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery moment towards his companion’s face. Once or twice he rearranged
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe light waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in toreador
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfashion. His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his jauntily slung
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaterproof expressed youth. But his figure fell into rotundity at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaist, his hair was scant and grey and his face, when the waves of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpression had passed over it, had a ravaged look.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well!... That takes the biscuit!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he added
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith humour:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it, _recherché_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbiscuit!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe became serious and silent when he had said this. His tongue was tired
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor he had been talking all the afternoon in a public-house in Dorset
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStreet. Most people considered Lenehan a leech but, in spite of this
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treputation, his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriends from forming any general policy against him. He had a brave
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand riddles. He was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy. No one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew how he achieved the stern task of living, but his name was vaguely
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassociated with racing tissues.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And where did you pick her up, Corley?” he asked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“One night, man,” he said, “I was going along Dame Street and I spotted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta fine tart under Waterhouse’s clock and said good-night, you know. So
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a slavey
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a house in Baggot Street. I put my arm round her and squeezed her a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbit that night. Then next Sunday, man, I met her by appointment. We went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout to Donnybrook and I brought her into a field there. She told me she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused to go with a dairyman.... It was fine, man. Cigarettes every night
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe’d bring me and paying the tram out and back. And one night she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought me two bloody fine cigars--O, the real cheese, you know, that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe old fellow used to smoke.... I was afraid, man, she’d get in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamily way. But she’s up to the dodge.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Maybe she thinks you’ll marry her,” said Lenehan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I told her I was out of a job,” said Corley. “I told her I was in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPim’s. She doesn’t know my name. I was too hairy to tell her that. But
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe thinks I’m a bit of class, you know.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan laughed again, noiselessly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of all the good ones ever I heard,” he said, “that emphatically takes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe biscuit.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley’s stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinherited his father’s frame and gait. He walked with his hands by his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side. His
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thead was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlarge round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrown out of another. He always stared straight before him as if he were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgive him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout himself: what he had said to such a person and what such a person
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe manner of Florentines.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassing girls but Lenehan’s gaze was fixed on the large faint moon
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcircled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweb of twilight across its face. At length he said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well ... tell me, Corley, I suppose you’ll be able to pull it off all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright, eh?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley closed one eye expressively as an answer.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is she game for that?” asked Lenehan dubiously. “You can never know
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomen.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s all right,” said Corley. “I know the way to get around her, man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe’s a bit gone on me.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’re what I call a gay Lothario,” said Lenehan. “And the proper kind
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a Lothario, too!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save himself
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\traillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s nothing to touch a good slavey,” he affirmed. “Take my tip for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“By one who has tried them all,” said Lenehan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“First I used to go with girls, you know,” said Corley, unbosoming;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“girls off the South Circular. I used to take them out, man, on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way. I used
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto spend money on them right enough,” he added, in a convincing tone, as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif he was conscious of being disbelieved.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know that game,” he said, “and it’s a mug’s game.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And damn the thing I ever got out of it,” said Corley.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ditto here,” said Lenehan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Only off of one of them,” said Corley.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecollection brightened his eyes. He too gazed at the pale disc of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She was ... a bit of all right,” he said regretfully.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was silent again. Then he added:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street one night
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith two fellows with her on a car.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I suppose that’s your doing,” said Lenehan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There was others at her before me,” said Corley philosophically.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He shook his head to and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfro and smiled.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You know you can’t kid me, Corley,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Honest to God!” said Corley. “Didn’t she tell me herself?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan made a tragic gesture.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Base betrayer!” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan skipped
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout into the road and peered up at the clock.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Twenty after,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Time enough,” said Corley. “She’ll be there all right. I always let her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twait a bit.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan laughed quietly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ecod! Corley, you know how to take them,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m up to all their little tricks,” Corley confessed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But tell me,” said Lenehan again, “are you sure you can bring it off
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall right? You know it’s a ticklish job. They’re damn close on that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoint. Eh?... What?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis bright, small eyes searched his companion’s face for reassurance.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinsect, and his brows gathered.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll pull it off,” he said. “Leave it to me, can’t you?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan said no more. He did not wish to ruffle his friend’s temper, to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted. A little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttact was necessary. But Corley’s brow was soon smooth again. His
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthoughts were running another way.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s a fine decent tart,” he said, with appreciation; “that’s what she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare Street. Not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfar from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway, playing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto a little ring of listeners. He plucked at the wires heedlessly,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglancing quickly from time to time at the face of each new-comer and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom time to time, wearily also, at the sky. His harp, too, heedless
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat her coverings had fallen about her knees, seemed weary alike of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes of strangers and of her master’s hands. One hand played in the bass
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe melody of _Silent, O Moyle_, while the other hand careered in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttreble after each group of notes. The notes of the air sounded deep and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe two young men walked up the street without speaking, the mournful
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusic following them. When they reached Stephen’s Green they crossed the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troad. Here the noise of trams, the lights and the crowd released them
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom their silence.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There she is!” said Corley.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing. She wore a blue
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdress and a white sailor hat. She stood on the curbstone, swinging a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsunshade in one hand. Lenehan grew lively.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Let’s have a look at her, Corley,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this face.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you trying to get inside me?” he asked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Damn it!” said Lenehan boldly, “I don’t want an introduction. All I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twant is to have a look at her. I’m not going to eat her.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O.... A look at her?” said Corley, more amiably. “Well ... I’ll tell
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou what. I’ll go over and talk to her and you can pass by.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Right!” said Lenehan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley had already thrown one leg over the chains when Lenehan called
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And after? Where will we meet?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Half ten,” answered Corley, bringing over his other leg.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Corner of Merrion Street. We’ll be coming back.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Work it all right now,” said Lenehan in farewell.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley did not answer. He sauntered across the road swaying his head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom side to side. His bulk, his easy pace, and the solid sound of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboots had something of the conqueror in them. He approached the young
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOnce or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbent her head.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan observed them for a few minutes. Then he walked rapidly along
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely. As he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapproached Hume Street corner he found the air heavily scented and his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman’s appearance. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad her Sunday finery on. Her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta belt of black leather. The great silver buckle of her belt seemed to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdepress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of her white
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblouse like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of her tulle collarette had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther bosom, stems upwards. Lenehan’s eyes noted approvingly her stout
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshort muscular body. Frank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tred cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her features were blunt. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleer, and two projecting front teeth. As he passed Lenehan took off his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcap and, after about ten seconds, Corley returned a salute to the air.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof position of his hat.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan walked as far as the Shelbourne Hotel where he halted and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaited. After waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, when they turned to the right, he followed them, stepping lightly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin his white shoes, down one side of Merrion Square. As he walked on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslowly, timing his pace to theirs, he watched Corley’s head which turned
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat every moment towards the young woman’s face like a big ball revolving
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton a pivot. He kept the pair in view until he had seen them climbing the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs of the Donnybrook tram; then he turned about and went back the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway he had come.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow that he was alone his face looked older. His gaiety seemed to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforsake him and, as he came by the railings of the Duke’s Lawn, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallowed his hand to run along them. The air which the harpist had played
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to control his movements. His softly padded feet played the melody
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile his fingers swept a scale of variations idly along the railings
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter each group of notes.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked listlessly round Stephen’s Green and then down Grafton Street.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThough his eyes took note of many elements of the crowd through which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the passed they did so morosely. He found trivial all that was meant to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharm him and did not answer the glances which invited him to be bold.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe knew that he would have to speak a great deal, to invent and to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamuse, and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproblem of how he could pass the hours till he met Corley again troubled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim a little. He could think of no way of passing them but to keep on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking. He turned to the left when he came to the corner of Rutland
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSquare and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street, the sombre look
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof which suited his mood. He paused at last before the window of a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoor-looking shop over which the words _Refreshment Bar_ were printed in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhite letters. On the glass of the window were two flying inscriptions:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Ginger Beer_ and _Ginger Ale_. A cut ham was exposed on a great blue
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdish while near it on a plate lay a segment of very light plum-pudding.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe eyed this food earnestly for some time and then, after glancing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twarily up and down the street, went into the shop quickly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was hungry for, except some biscuits which he had asked two grudging
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurates to bring him, he had eaten nothing since breakfast-time. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsat down at an uncovered wooden table opposite two work-girls and a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmechanic. A slatternly girl waited on him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How much is a plate of peas?” he asked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Three halfpence, sir,” said the girl.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Bring me a plate of peas,” he said, “and a bottle of ginger beer.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his entry
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been followed by a pause of talk. His face was heated. To appear
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnatural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable. The mechanic and the two work-girls examined him point by point
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore resuming their conversation in a subdued voice. The girl brought
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim a plate of grocer’s hot peas, seasoned with pepper and vinegar, a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfork and his ginger beer. He ate his food greedily and found it so good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he made a note of the shop mentally. When he had eaten all the peas
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the sipped his ginger beer and sat for some time thinking of Corley’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadventure. In his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers walking along
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome dark road; he heard Corley’s voice in deep energetic gallantries
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand saw again the leer of the young woman’s mouth. This vision made
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit. He was tired
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof knocking about, of pulling the devil by the tail, of shifts and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintrigues. He would be thirty-one in November. Would he never get a good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjob? Would he never have a home of his own? He thought how pleasant it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to sit down to.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had walked the streets long enough with friends and with girls. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew what those friends were worth: he knew the girls too. Experience
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad embittered his heart against the world. But all hope had not left
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. He felt better after having eaten than he had felt before, less
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweary of his life, less vanquished in spirit. He might yet be able to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsettle down in some snug corner and live happily if he could only come
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross some good simple-minded girl with a little of the ready.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop to begin his wandering again. He went into Capel Street and walked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong towards the City Hall. Then he turned into Dame Street. At the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorner of George’s Street he met two friends of his and stopped to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconverse with them. He was glad that he could rest from all his walking.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis friends asked him had he seen Corley and what was the latest. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treplied that he had spent the day with Corley. His friends talked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery little. They looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsometimes made a critical remark. One said that he had seen Mac an hour
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore in Westmoreland Street. At this Lenehan said that he had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Mac the night before in Egan’s. The young man who had seen Mac
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Westmoreland Street asked was it true that Mac had won a bit over
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta billiard match. Lenehan did not know: he said that Holohan had stood
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem drinks in Egan’s.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up George’s Street.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to the left at the City Markets and walked on into Grafton
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStreet. The crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood-night. He went as far as the clock of the College of Surgeons: it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas on the stroke of ten. He set off briskly along the northern side
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Green hurrying for fear Corley should return too soon. When he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treached the corner of Merrion Street he took his stand in the shadow of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlit it. He leaned against the lamp-post and kept his gaze fixed on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpart from which he expected to see Corley and the young woman return.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis mind became active again. He wondered had Corley managed it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuccessfully. He wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit to the last. He suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsituation as well as those of his own. But the memory of Corley’s slowly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trevolving head calmed him somewhat: he was sure Corley would pull it off
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall right. All at once the idea struck him that perhaps Corley had seen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther home by another way and given him the slip. His eyes searched the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet: there was no sign of them. Yet it was surely half-an-hour since
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons. Would Corley do
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta thing like that? He lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnervously. He strained his eyes as each tram stopped at the far corner
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the square. They must have gone home by another way. The paper of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a curse.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSuddenly he saw them coming towards him. He started with delight and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkeeping close to his lamp-post, tried to read the result in their walk.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick short steps,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile Corley kept beside her with his long stride. They did not seem to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe speaking. An intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsharp instrument. He knew Corley would fail; he knew it was no go.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at once, taking the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother footpath. When they stopped he stopped too. They talked for a few
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta house. Corley remained standing at the edge of the path, a little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistance from the front steps. Some minutes passed. Then the hall-door
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas opened slowly and cautiously. A woman came running down the front
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsteps and coughed. Corley turned and went towards her. His broad figure
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup the steps. The door closed on her and Corley began to walk swiftly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards Stephen’s Green.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan hurried on in the same direction. Some drops of light rain fell.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the house which the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung woman had entered to see that he was not observed, he ran eagerly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross the road. Anxiety and his swift run made him pant. He called out:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hallo, Corley!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley turned his head to see who had called him, and then continued
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshoulders with one hand.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hallo, Corley!” he cried again.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. He could
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee nothing there.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well?” he said. “Did it come off?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without answering,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley swerved to the left and went up the side street. His features
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuneasily. He was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Can’t you tell us?” he said. “Did you try her?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him. Then
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and, smiling,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. A small gold coin shone in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe palm.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE BOARDING HOUSE
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMRS MOONEY was a butcher’s daughter. She was a woman who was quite
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\table to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather’s foreman and opened a butcher’s shop near Spring Gardens. But as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoon as his father-in-law was dead Mr Mooney began to go to the devil.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no use
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaking him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few days
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter. By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbad meat he ruined his business. One night he went for his wife with the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour’s house.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a separation
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom him with care of the children. She would give him neither money
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsheriff’s man. He was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled above his little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long he sat in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbailiff’s room, waiting to be put on a job. Mrs Mooney, who had taken
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing woman. Her house
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIsle of Man and, occasionally, _artistes_ from the music-halls. Its
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresident population was made up of clerks from the city. She governed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstern and when to let things pass. All the resident young men spoke of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther as _The Madam_.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Mooney’s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone another. They discussed with one another the chances of favourites
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand outsiders. Jack Mooney, the Madam’s son, who was clerk to a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommission agent in Fleet Street, had the reputation of being a hard
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase. He was fond of using soldiers’ obscenities: usually he came home
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the small hours. When he met his friends he had always a good one to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thing--that is to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay, a likely horse or a likely _artiste_. He was also handy with the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmits and sang comic songs. On Sunday nights there would often be a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treunion in Mrs Mooney’s front drawing-room. The music-hall _artistes_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam’s daughter, would also sing. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsang:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_I’m a ... naughty girl. You needn’t sham: You know I am._
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull mouth. Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade her look like a little perverse madonna. Mrs Mooney had first
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsent her daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor’s office but, as a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisreputable sheriff’s man used to come every other day to the office,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaughter home again and set her to do housework. As Polly was very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlively the intention was to give her the run of the young men. Besides,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs Mooney, who was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnone of them meant business. Things went on so for a long time and Mrs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmen. She watched the pair and kept her own counsel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother’s persistent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilence could not be misunderstood. There had been no open complicity
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween mother and daughter, no open understanding but, though people
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the house began to talk of the affair, still Mrs Mooney did not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintervene. Polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung man was evidently perturbed. At last, when she judged it to be the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright moment, Mrs Mooney intervened. She dealt with moral problems as a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had made up her mind.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the boarding house were open
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\traised sashes. The belfry of George’s Church sent out constant peals and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained demeanour
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands. Breakfast
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcovered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof bacon-fat and bacon-rind. Mrs Mooney sat in the straw arm-chair and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twatched the servant Mary remove the breakfast things. She made Mary
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to help to make Tuesday’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbread-pudding. When the table was cleared, the broken bread collected,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sugar and butter safe under lock and key, she began to reconstruct
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe interview which she had had the night before with Polly. Things were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas she had suspected: she had been frank in her questions and Polly had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen frank in her answers. Both had been somewhat awkward, of course.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe had been made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and Polly had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tawkward but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttolerance.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbells of George’s Church had stopped ringing. It was seventeen minutes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpast eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street. She was sure
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe would win. To begin with she had all the weight of social opinion
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton her side: she was an outraged mother. She had allowed him to live
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeneath her roof, assuming that he was a man of honour, and he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsimply abused her hospitality. He was thirty-four or thirty-five years
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof age, so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld. He had simply taken advantage of Polly’s youth and inexperience:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat was evident. The question was: What reparation would he make?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere must be reparation made in such cases. It is all very well for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe man: he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having had his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt. Some mothers
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknown cases of it. But she would not do so. For her only one reparation
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould make up for the loss of her daughter’s honour: marriage.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe counted all her cards again before sending Mary up to Mr Doran’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom to say that she wished to speak with him. She felt sure she would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twin. He was a serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers. If it had been Mr Sheridan or Mr Meade or Bantam Lyons her task
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould have been much harder. She did not think he would face publicity.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair; details had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen invented by some. Besides, he had been employed for thirteen years
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a great Catholic wine-merchant’s office and publicity would mean for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim, perhaps, the loss of his job. Whereas if he agreed all might be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell. She knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad a bit of stuff put by.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNearly the half-hour! She stood up and surveyed herself in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpier-glass. The decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaughters off their hands.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning. He had made two
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobliged to desist. Three days’ reddish beard fringed his jaws and every
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto take them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation. The harm was done.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat could he do now but marry her or run away? He could not brazen it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout. The affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe certain to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teveryone else’s business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he heard in his excited imagination old Mr Leonard calling out in his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trasping voice: “Send Mr Doran here, please.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll his long years of service gone for nothing! All his industry and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiligence thrown away! As a young man he had sown his wild oats, of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod to his companions in public-houses. But that was all passed and done
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith ... nearly. He still bought a copy of _Reynolds’s Newspaper_ every
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweek but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyear lived a regular life. He had money enough to settle down on; it was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot that. But the family would look down on her. First of all there
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas her disreputable father and then her mother’s boarding house was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeginning to get a certain fame. He had a notion that he was being had.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe could imagine his friends talking of the affair and laughing. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_was_ a little vulgar; sometimes she said “I seen” and “If I had’ve
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknown.” But what would grammar matter if he really loved her? He could
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot make up his mind whether to like her or despise her for what she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad done. Of course he had done it too. His instinct urged him to remain
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfree, not to marry. Once you are married you are done for, it said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered. She told him all,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould speak with him that morning. She cried and threw her arms round
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this neck, saying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe would put an end to herself, she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright, never fear. He felt against his shirt the agitation of her bosom.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was not altogether his fault that it had happened. He remembered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell, with the curious patient memory of the celibate, the first casual
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaresses her dress, her breath, her fingers had given him. Then late one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnight as he was undressing for bed she had tapped at his door, timidly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe wanted to relight her candle at his for hers had been blown out by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta gust. It was her bath night. She wore a loose open combing-jacket
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof printed flannel. Her white instep shone in the opening of her furry
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her perfumed skin. From her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands and wrists too as she lit and steadied her candle a faint perfume
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarose.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn nights when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his dinner.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe scarcely knew what he was eating, feeling her beside him alone, at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnight, in the sleeping house. And her thoughtfulness! If the night was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyway cold or wet or windy there was sure to be a little tumbler of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpunch ready for him. Perhaps they could be happy together....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey used to go upstairs together on tiptoe, each with a candle, and on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe third landing exchange reluctant good-nights. They used to kiss. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremembered well her eyes, the touch of her hand and his delirium....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut delirium passes. He echoed her phrase, applying it to himself:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_“What am I to do?”_ The instinct of the celibate warned him to hold
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback. But the sin was there; even his sense of honour told him that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treparation must be made for such a sin.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile he was sitting with her on the side of the bed Mary came to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor and said that the missus wanted to see him in the parlour. He stood
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup to put on his coat and waistcoat, more helpless than ever. When he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas dressed he went over to her to comfort her. It would be all right,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever fear. He left her crying on the bed and moaning softly: _“O my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod!”_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGoing down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had to take them off and polish them. He longed to ascend through the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troof and fly away to another country where he would never hear again
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his trouble, and yet a force pushed him downstairs step by step.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe implacable faces of his employer and of the Madam stared upon his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscomfiture. On the last flight of stairs he passed Jack Mooney who was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of _Bass_. They saluted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoldly; and the lover’s eyes rested for a second or two on a thick
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbulldog face and a pair of thick short arms. When he reached the foot of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe staircase he glanced up and saw Jack regarding him from the door of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe return-room.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSuddenly he remembered the night when one of the music-hall _artistes_,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta little blond Londoner, had made a rather free allusion to Polly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe reunion had been almost broken up on account of Jack’s violence.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone tried to quiet him. The music-hall _artiste_, a little paler
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan usual, kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant: but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJack kept shouting at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton with _his_ sister he’d bloody well put his teeth down his throat, so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the would.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass. She dipped the end of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe towel in the water-jug and refreshed her eyes with the cool water.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot. She regarded
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her mind
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecret amiable memories. She rested the nape of her neck against the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcool iron bed-rail and fell into a reverie. There was no longer any
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperturbation visible on her face.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm, her memories
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future. Her hopes and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvisions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt last she heard her mother calling. She started to her feet and ran to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe banisters.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Polly! Polly!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, mamma?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come down, dear. Mr Doran wants to speak to you.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen she remembered what she had been waiting for.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA LITTLE CLOUD
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEIGHT years before he had seen his friend off at the North Wall and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twished him godspeed. Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby such success. Gallaher’s heart was in the right place and he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeserved to win. It was something to have a friend like that.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his meeting
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Gallaher, of Gallaher’s invitation and of the great city London
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because, though
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was but slightly under the average stature, he gave one the idea
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof being a little man. His hands were white and small, his frame was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfragile, his voice was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used perfume
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscreetly on his handkerchief. The half-moons of his nails were perfect
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish white
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tteeth.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought what changes those
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teight years had brought. The friend whom he had known under a shabby and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnecessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the London Press. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks. It
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told men who drowsed on the benches; it flickered upon all the moving
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfigures--on the children who ran screaming along the gravel paths and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton everyone who passed through the gardens. He watched the scene and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought of life; and (as always happened when he thought of life) he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecame sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of him. He felt how
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuseless it was to struggle against fortune, this being the burden of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home. He had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbought them in his bachelor days and many an evening, as he sat in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle room off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down from the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbookshelf and read out something to his wife. But shyness had always
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld him back; and so the books had remained on their shelves. At times
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the repeated lines to himself and this consoled him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this fellow-clerks punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and walked swiftly down
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHenrietta Street. The golden sunset was waning and the air had grown
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsharp. A horde of grimy children populated the street. They stood or
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsquatted like mice upon the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought. He picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin-like
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told nobility of Dublin had roystered. No memory of the past touched him,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor his mind was full of a present joy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had never been in Corless’s but he knew the value of the name. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliqueurs; and he had heard that the waiters there spoke French and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerman. Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn up before the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor and richly dressed ladies, escorted by cavaliers, alight and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenter quickly. They wore noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpowdered and they caught up their dresses, when they touched earth,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike alarmed Atalantas. He had always passed without turning his head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto look. It was his habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes, however, he courted the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcauses of his fear. He chose the darkest and narrowest streets and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he walked boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfootsteps troubled him, the wandering silent figures troubled him; and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to the right towards Capel Street. Ignatius Gallaher on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLondon Press! Who would have thought it possible eight years before?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill, now that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could remember
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmany signs of future greatness in his friend. People used to say that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher was wild. Of course, he did mix with a rakish set of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellows at that time, drank freely and borrowed money on all sides.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair, some money
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttransaction: at least, that was one version of his flight. But nobody
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdenied him talent. There was always a certain ... something in Ignatius
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself. Even when he was out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat elbows and at his wits’ end for money he kept up a bold face. Little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChandler remembered (and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his cheek) one of Ignatius Gallaher’s sayings when he was in a tight
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorner:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Half time now, boys,” he used to say light-heartedly. “Where’s my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsidering cap?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn’t but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadmire him for it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler quickened his pace. For the first time in his life he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt himself superior to the people he passed. For the first time his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street. There was no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away. You could
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo nothing in Dublin. As he crossed Grattan Bridge he looked down the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\triver towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses. They
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to him a band of tramps, huddled together along the riverbanks,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir old coats covered with dust and soot, stupefied by the panorama
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise, shake
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthemselves and begone. He wondered whether he could write a poem to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpress his idea. Perhaps Gallaher might be able to get it into some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLondon paper for him. Could he write something original? He was not sure
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttouched him took life within him like an infant hope. He stepped onward
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbravely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery step brought him nearer to London, farther from his own sober
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinartistic life. A light began to tremble on the horizon of his mind. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas not so old--thirty-two. His temperament might be said to be just
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the point of maturity. There were so many different moods and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpressions that he wished to express in verse. He felt them within him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tried to weigh his soul to see if it was a poet’s soul. Melancholy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas the dominant note of his temperament, he thought, but it was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmelancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and simple
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjoy. If he could give expression to it in a book of poems perhaps men
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould listen. He would never be popular: he saw that. He could not sway
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of kindred minds.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe English critics, perhaps, would recognise him as one of the Celtic
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool by reason of the melancholy tone of his poems; besides that, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould put in allusions. He began to invent sentences and phrases from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe notice which his book would get. _“Mr Chandler has the gift of easy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand graceful verse.” ... “A wistful sadness pervades these poems.” ...
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Celtic note.”_ It was a pity his name was not more Irish-looking.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPerhaps it would be better to insert his mother’s name before the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsurname: Thomas Malone Chandler, or better still: T. Malone Chandler. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould speak to Gallaher about it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto turn back. As he came near Corless’s his former agitation began to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tovermaster him and he halted before the door in indecision. Finally he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topened the door and entered.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoments. He looked about him, but his sight was confused by the shining
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof many red and green wine-glasses The bar seemed to him to be full
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof people and he felt that the people were observing him curiously. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced quickly to right and left (frowning slightly to make his errand
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappear serious), but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad turned to look at him: and there, sure enough, was Ignatius Gallaher
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaning with his back against the counter and his feet planted far
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapart.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hallo, Tommy, old hero, here you are! What is it to be? What will you
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave? I’m taking whisky: better stuff than we get across the water.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSoda? Lithia? No mineral? I’m the same. Spoils the flavour.... Here,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_garçon_, bring us two halves of malt whisky, like a good fellow....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWell, and how have you been pulling along since I saw you last? Dear
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod, how old we’re getting! Do you see any signs of aging in me--eh,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat? A little grey and thin on the top--what?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely cropped
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thead. His face was heavy, pale and clean-shaven. His eyes, which were of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbluish slate-colour, relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabove the vivid orange tie he wore. Between these rival features the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlips appeared very long and shapeless and colourless. He bent his head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand felt with two sympathetic fingers the thin hair at the crown. Little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChandler shook his head as a denial. Ignatius Galaher put on his hat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It pulls you down,” he said. “Press life. Always hurry and scurry,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and then, always to have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething new in your stuff. Damn proofs and printers, I say, for a few
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays. I’m deuced glad, I can tell you, to get back to the old country.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoes a fellow good, a bit of a holiday. I feel a ton better since I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanded again in dear dirty Dublin.... Here you are, Tommy. Water? Say
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You don’t know what’s good for you, my boy,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrink mine neat.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I drink very little as a rule,” said Little Chandler modestly. “An odd
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalf-one or so when I meet any of the old crowd: that’s all.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, cheerfully, “here’s to us and to old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttimes and old acquaintance.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey clinked glasses and drank the toast.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I met some of the old gang today,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “O’Hara
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseems to be in a bad way. What’s he doing?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Nothing,” said Little Chandler. “He’s gone to the dogs.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But Hogan has a good sit, hasn’t he?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes; he’s in the Land Commission.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I met him one night in London and he seemed to be very flush.... Poor
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Hara! Boose, I suppose?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Other things, too,” said Little Chandler shortly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher laughed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tommy,” he said, “I see you haven’t changed an atom. You’re the very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame serious person that used to lecture me on Sunday mornings when I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad a sore head and a fur on my tongue. You’d want to knock about a bit
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the world. Have you never been anywhere even for a trip?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ve been to the Isle of Man,” said Little Chandler.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher laughed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Isle of Man!” he said. “Go to London or Paris: Paris, for choice.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’d do you good.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Have you seen Paris?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I should think I have! I’ve knocked about there a little.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And is it really so beautiful as they say?” asked Little Chandler.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe sipped a little of his drink while Ignatius Gallaher finished his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboldly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Beautiful?” said Ignatius Gallaher, pausing on the word and on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflavour of his drink. “It’s not so beautiful, you know. Of course, it is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeautiful.... But it’s the life of Paris; that’s the thing. Ah, there’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno city like Paris for gaiety, movement, excitement....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler finished his whisky and, after some trouble, succeeded
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin catching the barman’s eye. He ordered the same again.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ve been to the Moulin Rouge,” Ignatius Gallaher continued when the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbarman had removed their glasses, “and I’ve been to all the Bohemian
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcafés. Hot stuff! Not for a pious chap like you, Tommy.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glasses:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen he touched his friend’s glass lightly and reciprocated the former
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoast. He was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned. Gallaher’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccent and way of expressing himself did not please him. There was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before. But
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps it was only the result of living in London amid the bustle and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompetition of the Press. The old personal charm was still there under
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis new gaudy manner. And, after all, Gallaher had lived, he had seen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe world. Little Chandler looked at his friend enviously.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Everything in Paris is gay,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “They believe in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenjoying life--and don’t you think they’re right? If you want to enjoy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyourself properly you must go to Paris. And, mind you, they’ve a great
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeeling for the Irish there. When they heard I was from Ireland they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere ready to eat me, man.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler took four or five sips from his glass.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me,” he said, “is it true that Paris is so ... immoral as they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Every place is immoral,” he said. “Of course you do find spicy bits in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tParis. Go to one of the students’ balls, for instance. That’s lively,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif you like, when the _cocottes_ begin to let themselves loose. You know
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat they are, I suppose?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ve heard of them,” said Little Chandler.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah,” he said, “you may say what you like. There’s no woman like the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tParisienne--for style, for go.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Then it is an immoral city,” said Little Chandler, with timid
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinsistence--“I mean, compared with London or Dublin?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“London!” said Ignatius Gallaher. “It’s six of one and half-a-dozen of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other. You ask Hogan, my boy. I showed him a bit about London when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was over there. He’d open your eye.... I say, Tommy, don’t make punch
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that whisky: liquor up.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, really....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, come on, another one won’t do you any harm. What is it? The same
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain, I suppose?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well ... all right.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_François_, the same again.... Will you smoke, Tommy?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher produced his cigar-case. The two friends lit their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll tell you my opinion,” said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge, “it’s a rum
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld. Talk of immorality! I’ve heard of cases--what am I saying?--I’ve
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknown them: cases of ... immorality....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in a calm
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thistorian’s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of many
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcapitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some things he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersonal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He revealed many
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttelling, with details, a story about an English duchess--a story which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the knew to be true. Little Chandler was astonished.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “here we are in old jog-along Dublin
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere nothing is known of such things.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How dull you must find it,” said Little Chandler, “after all the other
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplaces you’ve seen!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “it’s a relaxation to come over here,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou know. And, after all, it’s the old country, as they say, isn’t it?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYou can’t help having a certain feeling for it. That’s human nature....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut tell me something about yourself. Hogan told me you had ... tasted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe joys of connubial bliss. Two years ago, wasn’t it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler blushed and smiled.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” he said. “I was married last May twelve months.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I hope it’s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,” said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher. “I didn’t know your address or I’d have done so at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe time.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe extended his hand, which Little Chandler took.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Tommy,” he said, “I wish you and yours every joy in life, old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchap, and tons of money, and may you never die till I shoot you. And
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat’s the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend. You know that?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know that,” said Little Chandler.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Any youngsters?” said Ignatius Gallaher.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler blushed again.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We have one child,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Son or daughter?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A little boy.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Bravo,” he said, “I wouldn’t doubt you, Tommy.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlip with three childishly white front teeth.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I hope you’ll spend an evening with us,” he said, “before you go
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback. My wife will be delighted to meet you. We can have a little music
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thanks awfully, old chap,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “I’m sorry we didn’t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeet earlier. But I must leave tomorrow night.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tonight, perhaps...?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m awfully sorry, old man. You see I’m over here with another
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow, clever young chap he is too, and we arranged to go to a little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcard-party. Only for that....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, in that case....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But who knows?” said Ignatius Gallaher considerately. “Next year I may
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake a little skip over here now that I’ve broken the ice. It’s only a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasure deferred.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Very well,” said Little Chandler, “the next time you come we must have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan evening together. That’s agreed now, isn’t it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, that’s agreed,” said Ignatius Gallaher. “Next year if I come,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_parole d’honneur_.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And to clinch the bargain,” said Little Chandler, “we’ll just have one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore now.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is it to be the last?” he said. “Because you know, I have an a.p.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, yes, positively,” said Little Chandler.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Very well, then,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “let us have another one as a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_deoc an doruis_--that’s good vernacular for a small whisky, I believe.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler ordered the drinks. The blush which had risen to his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface a few moments before was establishing itself. A trifle made
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited. Three small
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhiskies had gone to his head and Gallaher’s strong cigar had confused
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this mind, for he was a delicate and abstinent person. The adventure of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeeting Gallaher after eight years, of finding himself with Gallaher
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Corless’s surrounded by lights and noise, of listening to Gallaher’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstories and of sharing for a brief space Gallaher’s vagrant and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttriumphant life, upset the equipoise of his sensitive nature. He felt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacutely the contrast between his own life and his friend’s and it seemed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto him unjust. Gallaher was his inferior in birth and education. He was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done, or
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould ever do, something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgot the chance. What was it that stood in his way? His unfortunate
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttimidity! He wished to vindicate himself in some way, to assert his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanhood. He saw behind Gallaher’s refusal of his invitation. Gallaher
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIreland by his visit.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe barman brought their drinks. Little Chandler pushed one glass
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards his friend and took up the other boldly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who knows?” he said, as they lifted their glasses. “When you come next
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyear I may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Mrs Ignatius Gallaher.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover the rim of his glass. When he had drunk he smacked his lips
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdecisively, set down his glass and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No blooming fear of that, my boy. I’m going to have my fling first and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee a bit of life and the world before I put my head in the sack--if I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tever do.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Some day you will,” said Little Chandler calmly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIgnatius Gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this friend.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You think so?” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’ll put your head in the sack,” repeated Little Chandler stoutly,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“like everyone else if you can find the girl.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetrayed himself; but, though the colour had heightened in his cheek, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not flinch from his friend’s gaze. Ignatius Gallaher watched him for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta few moments and then said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If ever it occurs, you may bet your bottom dollar there’ll be no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmooning and spooning about it. I mean to marry money. She’ll have a good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfat account at the bank or she won’t do for me.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler shook his head.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why, man alive,” said Ignatius Gallaher, vehemently, “do you know what
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit is? I’ve only to say the word and tomorrow I can have the woman
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the cash. You don’t believe it? Well, I know it. There are
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thundreds--what am I saying?--thousands of rich Germans and Jews, rotten
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith money, that’d only be too glad.... You wait a while my boy. See if
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI don’t play my cards properly. When I go about a thing I mean business,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI tell you. You just wait.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tossed his glass to his mouth, finished his drink and laughed loudly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer tone:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But I’m in no hurry. They can wait. I don’t fancy tying myself up to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone woman, you know.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Must get a bit stale, I should think,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarms. To save money they kept no servant but Annie’s young sister Monica
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto help. But Monica had gone home long ago. It was a quarter to nine.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler had come home late for tea and, moreover, he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Bewley’s. Of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers. She said she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar. She put the sleeping child
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeftly in his arms and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here. Don’t waken him.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlight fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorn. It was Annie’s photograph. Little Chandler looked at it, pausing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the thin tight lips. She wore the pale blue summer blouse which he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad brought her home as a present one Saturday. It had cost him ten and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\televenpence; but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him! How
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had suffered that day, waiting at the shop door until the shop was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tempty, standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe girl piled ladies’ blouses before him, paying at the desk and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforgetting to take up the odd penny of his change, being called back by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cashier, and finally, striving to hide his blushes as he left the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied. When he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought the blouse home Annie kissed him and said it was very pretty and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstylish; but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt first she wanted to take it back but when she tried it on she was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelighted with it, especially with the make of the sleeves, and kissed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim and said he was very good to think of her.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHm!...
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoldly. Certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty. But
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the found something mean in it. Why was it so unconscious and ladylike?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe composure of the eyes irritated him. They repelled him and defied
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim: there was no passion in them, no rapture. He thought of what
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGallaher had said about rich Jewesses. Those dark Oriental eyes, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought, how full they are of passion, of voluptuous longing!... Why had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the married the eyes in the photograph?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom. He found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbought for his house on the hire system. Annie had chosen it herself and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit reminded him of her. It too was prim and pretty. A dull resentment
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst his life awoke within him. Could he not escape from his little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse? Was it too late for him to try to live bravely like Gallaher?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCould he go to London? There was the furniture still to be paid for. If
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the could only write a book and get it published, that might open the way
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA volume of Byron’s poems lay before him on the table. He opened it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto read the first poem in the book:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom, Not e’en a Zephyr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twanders through the grove, Whilst I return to view my Margaret’s tomb
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd scatter flowers on the dust I love._
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHow melancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that, express the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmelancholy of his soul in verse? There were so many things he wanted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto describe: his sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texample. If he could get back again into that mood....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and tried to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thush it: but it would not be hushed. He began to rock it to and fro in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this arms but its wailing cry grew keener. He rocked it faster while his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes began to read the second stanza:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Within this narrow cell reclines her clay, That clay where once...._
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was useless. He couldn’t read. He couldn’t do anything. The wailing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was useless, useless!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbending to the child’s face he shouted:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Stop!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscream. He jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up and down the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom with the child in his arms. It began to sob piteously, losing its
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath for four or five seconds, and then bursting out anew. The thin
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalls of the room echoed the sound. He tried to soothe it but it sobbed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore convulsively. He looked at the contracted and quivering face of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe child and began to be alarmed. He counted seven sobs without a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreak between them and caught the child to his breast in fright. If it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdied!...
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe door was burst open and a young woman ran in, panting.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is it? What is it?” she cried.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe child, hearing its mother’s voice, broke out into a paroxysm of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsobbing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s nothing, Annie ... it’s nothing.... He began to cry....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What have you done to him?” she cried, glaring into his face.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart closed together as he met the hatred in them. He began to stammer:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s nothing.... He ... he began to cry.... I couldn’t ... I didn’t do
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything.... What?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGiving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room, clasping
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe child tightly in her arms and murmuring:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“My little man! My little mannie! Was ‘ou frightened, love?... There
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow, love! There now!... Lambabaun! Mamma’s little lamb of the world!...
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere now!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCOUNTERPARTS
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the tube, a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfurious voice called out in a piercing North of Ireland accent:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Send Farrington here!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta desk:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Alleyne wants you upstairs.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man muttered “_Blast_ him!” under his breath and pushed back his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchair to stand up. When he stood up he was tall and of great bulk.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirty. He lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe office with a heavy step.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing, where
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta door bore a brass plate with the inscription _Mr Alleyne_. Here he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. The shrill voice
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcried:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come in!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man entered Mr Alleyne’s room. Simultaneously Mr Alleyne, a little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a clean-shaven face, shot his head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup over a pile of documents. The head itself was so pink and hairless it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed like a large egg reposing on the papers. Mr Alleyne did not lose
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta moment:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Farrington? What is the meaning of this? Why have I always to complain
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof you? May I ask you why you haven’t made a copy of that contract
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween Bodley and Kirwan? I told you it must be ready by four o’clock.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But Mr Shelley said, sir----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_Mr Shelley said, sir...._ Kindly attend to what I say and not to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat _Mr Shelley says, sir_. You have always some excuse or another for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshirking work. Let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis evening I’ll lay the matter before Mr Crosbie.... Do you hear me
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, sir.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Do you hear me now?... Ay and another little matter! I might as well be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking to the wall as talking to you. Understand once for all that you
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half. How many
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourses do you want, I’d like to know.... Do you mind me, now?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, sir.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers. The man stared
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of Crosbie &
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlleyne, gauging its fragility. A spasm of rage gripped his throat for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta few moments and then passed, leaving after it a sharp sensation of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthirst. The man recognised the sensation and felt that he must have a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood night’s drinking. The middle of the month was passed and, if he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould get the copy done in time, Mr Alleyne might give him an order on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cashier. He stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpapers. Suddenly Mr Alleyne began to upset all the papers, searching for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething. Then, as if he had been unaware of the man’s presence till
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat moment, he shot up his head again, saying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Eh? Are you going to stand there all day? Upon my word, Farrington, you
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake things easy!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was waiting to see....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Very good, you needn’t wait to see. Go downstairs and do your work.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man walked heavily towards the door and, as he went out of the room,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the heard Mr Alleyne cry after him that if the contract was not copied by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening Mr Crosbie would hear of the matter.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremained to be copied. He took up his pen and dipped it in the ink but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the continued to stare stupidly at the last words he had written: _In no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase shall the said Bernard Bodley be...._ The evening was falling and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a few minutes they would be lighting the gas: then he could write. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt that he must slake the thirst in his throat. He stood up from his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdesk and, lifting the counter as before, passed out of the office. As he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas passing out the chief clerk looked at him inquiringly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s all right, Mr Shelley,” said the man, pointing with his finger to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindicate the objective of his journey.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe chief clerk glanced at the hat-rack but, seeing the row complete,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffered no remark. As soon as he was on the landing the man pulled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta shepherd’s plaid cap out of his pocket, put it on his head and ran
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquickly down the rickety stairs. From the street door he walked on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfurtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce dived into a doorway. He was now safe in the dark snug of O’Neill’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop, and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinflamed face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he called out:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here, Pat, give us a g.p., like a good fellow.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe curate brought him a glass of plain porter. The man drank it at a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgulp and asked for a caraway seed. He put his penny on the counter and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom, retreated out of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsnug as furtively as he had entered it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDarkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFebruary and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit. The man went up
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the houses until he reached the door of the office, wondering whether
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the could finish his copy in time. On the stairs a moist pungent odour of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfumes saluted his nose: evidently Miss Delacour had come while he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas out in O’Neill’s. He crammed his cap back again into his pocket and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tre-entered the office, assuming an air of absent-mindedness.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Alleyne has been calling for you,” said the chief clerk severely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where were you?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif to intimate that their presence prevented him from answering. As the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know that game,” he said. “Five times in one day is a little bit....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWell, you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDelacour case for Mr Alleyne.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tporter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and, as he sat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown at his desk to get what was required, he realised how hopeless was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglasses. He got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffice. He hoped Mr Alleyne would not discover that the last two letters
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere missing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr Alleyne’s room. Miss
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDelacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish appearance. Mr Alleyne was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid to be sweet on her or on her money. She came to the office often
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand stayed a long time when she came. She was sitting beside his desk
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnodding the great black feather in her hat. Mr Alleyne had swivelled his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknee. The man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut neither Mr Alleyne nor Miss Delacour took any notice of his bow.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards him as if to say: _“That’s all right: you can go.”_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stared intently at the incomplete phrase: _In no case shall the said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBernard Bodley be_ ... and thought how strange it was that the last
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthree words began with the same letter. The chief clerk began to hurry
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Parker, saying she would never have the letters typed in time for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpost. The man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand then set to work to finish his copy. But his head was not clear and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the public-house. It
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a night for hot punches. He struggled on with his copy, but when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write. Blast it!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe couldn’t finish it in time. He longed to execrate aloud, to bring
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this fist down on something violently. He was so enraged that he wrote
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Bernard Bernard_ instead of _Bernard Bodley_ and had to begin again on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta clean sheet.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded. His
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbody ached to do something, to rush out and revel in violence. All
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe indignities of his life enraged him.... Could he ask the cashier
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprivately for an advance? No, the cashier was no good, no damn good:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the wouldn’t give an advance.... He knew where he would meet the boys:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeonard and O’Halloran and Nosey Flynn. The barometer of his emotional
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnature was set for a spell of riot.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore he answered. Mr Alleyne and Miss Delacour were standing outside
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe counter and all the clerks had turn round in anticipation of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething. The man got up from his desk. Mr Alleyne began a tirade of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabuse, saying that two letters were missing. The man answered that he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew nothing about them, that he had made a faithful copy. The tirade
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontinued: it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trestrain his fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know nothing about any other two letters,” he said stupidly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_You--know--nothing_. Of course you know nothing,” said Mr Alleyne.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me,” he added, glancing first for approval to the lady beside him,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“do you take me for a fool? Do you think me an utter fool?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man glanced from the lady’s face to the little egg-shaped head and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback again; and, almost before he was aware of it, his tongue had found
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta felicitous moment:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t think, sir,” he said, “that that’s a fair question to put to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. Everyone was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tastounded (the author of the witticism no less than his neighbours) and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Delacour, who was a stout amiable person, began to smile broadly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild rose and his mouth twitched with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta dwarf’s passion. He shook his fist in the man’s face till it seemed to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvibrate like the knob of some electric machine:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You impertinent ruffian! You impertinent ruffian! I’ll make short work
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof you! Wait till you see! You’ll apologise to me for your impertinence
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor you’ll quit the office instanter! You’ll quit this, I’m telling you,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor you’ll apologise to me!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the cashier
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould come out alone. All the clerks passed out and finally the cashier
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame out with the chief clerk. It was no use trying to say a word to him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he was with the chief clerk. The man felt that his position was bad
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenough. He had been obliged to offer an abject apology to Mr Alleyne for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this impertinence but he knew what a hornet’s nest the office would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe for him. He could remember the way in which Mr Alleyne had hounded
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle Peake out of the office in order to make room for his own nephew.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe felt savage and thirsty and revengeful, annoyed with himself and with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teveryone else. Mr Alleyne would never give him an hour’s rest; his life
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be a hell to him. He had made a proper fool of himself this time.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCould he not keep his tongue in his cheek? But they had never pulled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether from the first, he and Mr Alleyne, ever since the day Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlleyne had overheard him mimicking his North of Ireland accent to amuse
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHiggins and Miss Parker: that had been the beginning of it. He might
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave tried Higgins for the money, but sure Higgins never had anything
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor himself. A man with two establishments to keep up, of course he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouldn’t....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the public-house.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe fog had begun to chill him and he wondered could he touch Pat in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Neill’s. He could not touch him for more than a bob--and a bob was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno use. Yet he must get money somewhere or other: he had spent his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast penny for the g.p. and soon it would be too late for getting money
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanywhere. Suddenly, as he was fingering his watch-chain, he thought of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTerry Kelly’s pawn-office in Fleet Street. That was the dart! Why didn’t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the think of it sooner?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly, muttering to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself that they could all go to hell because he was going to have a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood night of it. The clerk in Terry Kelly’s said _A crown!_ but the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsignor held out for six shillings; and in the end the six shillings
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas allowed him literally. He came out of the pawn-office joyfully,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaking a little cylinder, of the coins between his thumb and fingers. In
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWestmoreland Street the footpaths were crowded with young men and women
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treturning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout the names of the evening editions. The man passed through the crowd,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmasterfully at the office-girls. His head was full of the noises of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram-gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurling fumes of punch. As he walked on he preconsidered the terms in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he would narrate the incident to the boys:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So, I just looked at him--coolly, you know, and looked at her. Then I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked back at him again--taking my time, you know. ‘I don’t think that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat’s a fair question to put to me,’ says I.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNosey Flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of Davy Byrne’s and, when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the heard the story, he stood Farrington a half-one, saying it was as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmart a thing as ever he heard. Farrington stood a drink in his turn.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a while O’Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepeated to them. O’Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttold the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Callan’s of Fownes’s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot as clever as Farrington’s retort. At this Farrington told the boys
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto polish off that and have another.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJust as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfive small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing when he showed the way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFarrington’s face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _“And here was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy nabs, as cool as you please,”_ while Farrington looked at the company
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen that round was over there was a pause. O’Halloran had money but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tneither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the city. Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tformed a little party at the corner of the counter. They began to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWeathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_artiste_. Farrington stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake a small Irish and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became theatrical.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWeathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He promised to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that Farrington
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldn’t go because he was a married man; and Farrington’s heavy dirty
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchaffed. Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan’s in Poolbeg
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStreet.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan’s. They went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the parlour at the back and O’Halloran ordered small hot specials
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall round. They were all beginning to feel mellow. Farrington was just
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstanding another round when Weathers came back. Much to Farrington’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trelief he drank a glass of bitter this time. Funds were getting low but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey had enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with big
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTivoli. Farrington’s eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone of the young women. There was something striking in her appearance.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAn immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgloves, reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarm which she moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrown eyes. The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced at him once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe brushed against his chair and said _“O, pardon!”_ in a London
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback at him, but he was disappointed. He cursed his want of money and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all the whiskies and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tApollinaris which he had stood to Weathers. If there was one thing that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the hated it was a sponge. He was so angry that he lost count of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconversation of his friends.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeats of strength. Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuphold the national honour. Farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand showed his biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands. When Paddy Leonard said _“Go!”_ each was to try to bring down
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other’s hand on to the table. Farrington looked very serious and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdetermined.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topponent’s hand slowly down on to the table. Farrington’s dark
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaving been defeated by such a stripling.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’re not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair,” he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who’s not playing fair?” said the other.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come on again. The two best out of three.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington’s forehead,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the pallor of Weathers’ complexion changed to peony. Their hands
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand arms trembled under the stress. After a long struggle Weathers again
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought his opponent’s hand slowly on to the table. There was a murmur
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof applause from the spectators. The curate, who was standing beside
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe table, nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamiliarity:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah! that’s the knack!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What the hell do you know about it?” said Farrington fiercely, turning
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the man. “What do you put in your gab for?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sh, sh!” said O’Halloran, observing the violent expression of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFarrington’s face. “Pony up, boys. We’ll have just one little smahan
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore and then we’ll be off.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA very sullen-faced man stood at the corner of O’Connell Bridge
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him home. He was full
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof smouldering anger and revengefulness. He felt humiliated and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he had only twopence in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this pocket. He cursed everything. He had done for himself in the office,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpawned his watch, spent all his money; and he had not even got drunk.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treeking public-house. He had lost his reputation as a strong man, having
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled with fury and, when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed against him and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid _Pardon!_ his fury nearly choked him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered his great body
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong in the shadow of the wall of the barracks. He loathed returning
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his home. When he went in by the side-door he found the kitchen empty
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the kitchen fire nearly out. He bawled upstairs:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ada! Ada!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis wife was a little sharp-faced woman who bullied her husband when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was sober and was bullied by him when he was drunk. They had five
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildren. A little boy came running down the stairs.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who is that?” said the man, peering through the darkness.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Me, pa.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who are you? Charlie?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, pa. Tom.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where’s your mother?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s out at the chapel.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s right.... Did she think of leaving any dinner for me?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, pa. I----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Light the lamp. What do you mean by having the place in darkness? Are
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other children in bed?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little boy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlit the lamp. He began to mimic his son’s flat accent, saying half to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself: _“At the chapel. At the chapel, if you please!”_ When the lamp
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas lit he banged his fist on the table and shouted:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What’s for my dinner?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m going ... to cook it, pa,” said the little boy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“On that fire! You let the fire out! By God, I’ll teach you to do that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took a step to the door and seized the walking-stick which was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstanding behind it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll teach you to let the fire out!” he said, rolling up his sleeve in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\torder to give his arm free play.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe little boy cried _“O, pa!”_ and ran whimpering round the table, but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe man followed him and caught him by the coat. The little boy looked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout him wildly but, seeing no way of escape, fell upon his knees.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, you’ll let the fire out the next time!” said the man striking at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim vigorously with the stick. “Take that, you little whelp!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh. He clasped
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hands together in the air and his voice shook with fright.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, pa!” he cried. “Don’t beat me, pa! And I’ll ... I’ll say a _Hail
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary_ for you.... I’ll say a _Hail Mary_ for you, pa, if you don’t beat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme.... I’ll say a _Hail Mary_....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCLAY
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE matron had given her leave to go out as soon as the women’s tea was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover and Maria looked forward to her evening out. The kitchen was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspick and span: the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboilers. The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfour very big barmbracks. These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if you went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcloser you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand were ready to be handed round at tea. Maria had cut them herself.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very long
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnose and a very long chin. She talked a little through her nose, always
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoothingly: _“Yes, my dear,”_ and _“No, my dear.”_ She was always sent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaking peace. One day the matron had said to her:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Maria, you are a veritable peace-maker!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the compliment.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Ginger Mooney was always saying what she wouldn’t do to the dummy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho had charge of the irons if it wasn’t for Maria. Everyone was so fond
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Maria.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe women would have their tea at six o’clock and she would be able to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget away before seven. From Ballsbridge to the Pillar, twenty minutes;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the Pillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to buy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe things. She would be there before eight. She took out her purse with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe silver clasps and read again the words _A Present from Belfast_. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas very fond of that purse because Joe had brought it to her five years
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore when he and Alphy had gone to Belfast on a Whit-Monday trip. In
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe purse were two half-crowns and some coppers. She would have five
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshillings clear after paying tram fare. What a nice evening they would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave, all the children singing! Only she hoped that Joe wouldn’t come in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrunk. He was so different when he took any drink.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOften he had wanted her to go and live with them; but she would have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt herself in the way (though Joe’s wife was ever so nice with her)
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand she had become accustomed to the life of the laundry. Joe was a good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow. She had nursed him and Alphy too; and Joe used often say:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mamma is mamma but Maria is my proper mother.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter the break-up at home the boys had got her that position in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Dublin by Lamplight_ laundry, and she liked it. She used to have such
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bad opinion of Protestants but now she thought they were very nice
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople, a little quiet and serious, but still very nice people to live
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith. Then she had her plants in the conservatory and she liked looking
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter them. She had lovely ferns and wax-plants and, whenever anyone
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame to visit her, she always gave the visitor one or two slips from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther conservatory. There was one thing she didn’t like and that was the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttracts on the walks; but the matron was such a nice person to deal with,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso genteel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the cook told her everything was ready she went into the women’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom and began to pull the big bell. In a few minutes the women began
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpetticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsteaming arms. They settled down before their huge mugs which the cook
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the dummy filled up with hot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin huge tin cans. Maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand saw that every woman got her four slices. There was a great deal of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing and joking during the meal. Lizzie Fleming said Maria was sure
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto get the ring and, though Fleming had said that for so many Hallow
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEves, Maria had to laugh and say she didn’t want any ring or man either;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with disappointed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin. Then
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGinger Mooney lifted up her mug of tea and proposed Maria’s health while
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the other women clattered with their mugs on the table, and said she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sorry she hadn’t a sup of porter to drink it in. And Maria laughed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin and till
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther minute body nearly shook itself asunder because she knew that Mooney
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeant well though, of course, she had the notions of a common woman.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut wasn’t Maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the dummy had begun to clear away the tea-things! She went into
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther little bedroom and, remembering that the next morning was a mass
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning, changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six. Then she took
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff her working skirt and her house-boots and laid her best skirt out on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bed and her tiny dress-boots beside the foot of the bed. She changed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther blouse too and, as she stood before the mirror, she thought of how
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe used to dress for mass on Sunday morning when she was a young girl;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand she looked with quaint affection at the diminutive body which she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad so often adorned. In spite of its years she found it a nice tidy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle body.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was glad
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her old brown waterproof. The tram was full and she had to sit on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle stool at the end of the car, facing all the people, with her toes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbarely touching the floor. She arranged in her mind all she was going to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo and thought how much better it was to be independent and to have your
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\town money in your pocket. She hoped they would have a nice evening. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sure they would but she could not help thinking what a pity it was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlphy and Joe were not speaking. They were always falling out now but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen they were boys together they used to be the best of friends: but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch was life.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe got out of her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way quickly among
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe crowds. She went into Downes’s cake-shop but the shop was so full of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople that it was a long time before she could get herself attended
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto. She bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes, and at last came out of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop laden with a big bag. Then she thought what else would she buy: she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twanted to buy something really nice. They would be sure to have plenty
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof apples and nuts. It was hard to know what to buy and all she could
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthink of was cake. She decided to buy some plumcake but Downes’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she went over to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta shop in Henry Street. Here she was a long time in suiting herself and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stylish young lady behind the counter, who was evidently a little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tannoyed by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she wanted to buy. That
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake, parcelled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit up and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Two-and-four, please.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe thought she would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram because none
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the young men seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made room
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her. He was a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat; he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta square red face and a greyish moustache. Maria thought he was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcolonel-looking gentleman and she reflected how much more polite he was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan the young men who simply stared straight before them. The gentleman
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to chat with her about Hallow Eve and the rainy weather. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves while they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere young. Maria agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thems. He was very nice with her, and when she was getting out at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCanal Bridge she thanked him and bowed, and he bowed to her and raised
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hat and smiled agreeably, and while she was going up along the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterrace, bending her tiny head under the rain, she thought how easy it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEverybody said: _“O, here’s Maria!”_ when she came to Joe’s house. Joe
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas there, having come home from business, and all the children had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir Sunday dresses on. There were two big girls in from next door
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand games were going on. Maria gave the bag of cakes to the eldest boy,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlphy, to divide and Mrs Donnelly said it was too good of her to bring
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch a big bag of cakes and made all the children say:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thanks, Maria.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Maria said she had brought something special for papa and mamma,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething they would be sure to like, and she began to look for her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplumcake. She tried in Downes’s bag and then in the pockets of her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaterproof and then on the hallstand but nowhere could she find it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen she asked all the children had any of them eaten it--by mistake, of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse--but the children all said no and looked as if they did not like
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing. Everybody had a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsolution for the mystery and Mrs Donnelly said it was plain that Maria
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad left it behind her in the tram. Maria, remembering how confused the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentleman with the greyish moustache had made her, coloured with shame
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand vexation and disappointment. At the thought of the failure of her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing she nearly cried outright.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Joe said it didn’t matter and made her sit down by the fire. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas very nice with her. He told her all that went on in his office,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager. Maria
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not understand why Joe laughed so much over the answer he had made
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto deal with. Joe said he wasn’t so bad when you knew how to take him,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he was a decent sort so long as you didn’t rub him the wrong way.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen the two next-door girls handed round the nuts. Nobody could find
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid they expect Maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker. But Maria said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe didn’t like nuts and that they weren’t to bother about her. Then Joe
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked would she take a bottle of stout and Mrs Donnelly said there was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tport wine too in the house if she would prefer that. Maria said she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould rather they didn’t ask her to take anything: but Joe insisted.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttimes and Maria thought she would put in a good word for Alphy. But Joe
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcried that God might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this brother again and Maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatter. Mrs Donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeak that way of his own flesh and blood but Joe said that Alphy was no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it. But
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJoe said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand asked his wife to open some more stout. The two next-door girls
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his wife in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand then led the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnext-door girls got the ring Mrs Donnelly shook her finger at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblushing girl as much as to say: _O, I know all about it!_ They insisted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen on blindfolding Maria and leading her up to the table to see
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat she would get; and, while they were putting on the bandage, Maria
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther chin.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thand out in the air as she was told to do. She moved her hand about here
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand there in the air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor took off her bandage. There was a pause for a few seconds; and then
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta great deal of scuffling and whispering. Somebody said something about
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe garden, and at last Mrs Donnelly said something very cross to one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the next-door girls and told her to throw it out at once: that was no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplay. Maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she had to do
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit over again: and this time she got the prayer-book.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter that Mrs Donnelly played Miss McCloud’s Reel for the children
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Joe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they were all quite merry
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain and Mrs Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas out because she had got the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso nice to her as he was that night, so full of pleasant talk and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treminiscences. She said they were all very good to her.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe not sing some little song before she went, one of the old songs.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Donnelly said _“Do, please, Maria!”_ and so Maria had to get up
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand stand beside the piano. Mrs Donnelly bade the children be quiet
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand listen to Maria’s song. Then she played the prelude and said _“Now,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaria!”_ and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice. She sang _I Dreamt that I Dwelt_, and when she came to the second
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tverse she sang again:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls With vassals and serfs at my side
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd of all who assembled within those walls That I was the hope and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpride. I had riches too great to count, could boast Of a high ancestral
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname, But I also dreamt, which pleased me most, That you loved me still
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe same._
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsong Joe was very much moved. He said that there was no time like the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong ago and no music for him like poor old Balfe, whatever other people
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmight say; and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfind what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttell him where the corkscrew was.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA PAINFUL CASE
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMR JAMES DUFFY lived in Chapelizod because he wished to live as far as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and pretentious. He lived
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which Dublin is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuilt. The lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from pictures.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had himself bought every article of furniture in the room: a black
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tiron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a clothes-rack,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdouble desk. A bookcase had been made in an alcove by means of shelves
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof white wood. The bed was clothed with white bedclothes and a black
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand scarlet rug covered the foot. A little hand-mirror hung above the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twashstand and during the day a white-shaded lamp stood as the sole
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tornament of the mantelpiece. The books on the white wooden shelves were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarranged from below upwards according to bulk. A complete Wordsworth
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the _Maynooth
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCatechism_, sewn into the cloth cover of a notebook, stood at one end
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the top shelf. Writing materials were always on the desk. In the desk
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlay a manuscript translation of Hauptmann’s _Michael Kramer_, the stage
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirections of which were written in purple ink, and a little sheaf of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpapers held together by a brass pin. In these sheets a sentence was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinscribed from time to time and, in an ironical moment, the headline of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan advertisement for _Bile Beans_ had been pasted on to the first sheet.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn lifting the lid of the desk a faint fragrance escaped--the fragrance
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof new cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or of an overripe apple
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich might have been left there and forgotten.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental disorder.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA mediæval doctor would have called him saturnine. His face, which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarried the entire tale of his years, was of the brown tint of Dublin
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreets. On his long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth. His cheekbones
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talso gave his face a harsh character; but there was no harshness in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes which, looking at the world from under their tawny eyebrows, gave
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe impression of a man ever alert to greet a redeeming instinct in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers but often disappointed. He lived at a little distance from his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbody, regarding his own acts with doubtful side-glances. He had an odd
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tautobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperson and a predicate in the past tense. He never gave alms to beggars
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand walked firmly, carrying a stout hazel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had been for many years cashier of a private bank in Baggot Street.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery morning he came in from Chapelizod by tram. At midday he went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Dan Burke’s and took his lunch--a bottle of lager beer and a small
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrayful of arrowroot biscuits. At four o’clock he was set free. He dined
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin an eating-house in George’s Street where he felt himself safe from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe society of Dublin’s gilded youth and where there was a certain plain
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonesty in the bill of fare. His evenings were spent either before his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlandlady’s piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city. His liking
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor Mozart’s music brought him sometimes to an opera or a concert: these
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere the only dissipations of his life.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had neither companions nor friends, church nor creed. He lived his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspiritual life without any communion with others, visiting his relatives
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat Christmas and escorting them to the cemetery when they died. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperformed these two social duties for old dignity’s sake but conceded
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing further to the conventions which regulate the civic life. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallowed himself to think that in certain circumstances he would rob
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this bank but, as these circumstances never arose, his life rolled out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevenly--an adventureless tale.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne evening he found himself sitting beside two ladies in the Rotunda.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe house, thinly peopled and silent, gave distressing prophecy of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailure. The lady who sat next him looked round at the deserted house
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce or twice and then said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What a pity there is such a poor house tonight! It’s so hard on people
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto have to sing to empty benches.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took the remark as an invitation to talk. He was surprised that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe seemed so little awkward. While they talked he tried to fix her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpermanently in his memory. When he learned that the young girl beside
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther was her daughter he judged her to be a year or so younger than
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself. Her face, which must have been handsome, had remained
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintelligent. It was an oval face with strongly marked features. The eyes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere very dark blue and steady. Their gaze began with a defiant note
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut was confused by what seemed a deliberate swoon of the pupil into the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tiris, revealing for an instant a temperament of great sensibility. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpupil reasserted itself quickly, this half-disclosed nature fell again
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder the reign of prudence, and her astrakhan jacket, moulding a bosom
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a certain fullness, struck the note of defiance more definitely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTerrace and seized the moments when her daughter’s attention was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiverted to become intimate. She alluded once or twice to her husband
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning. Her name
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas Mrs Sinico. Her husband’s great-great-grandfather had come from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeghorn. Her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin and Holland; and they had one child.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMeeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappointment. She came. This was the first of many meetings; they met
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether. Mr Duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\task him to her house. Captain Sinico encouraged his visits, thinking
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat his daughter’s hand was in question. He had dismissed his wife so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyone else would take an interest in her. As the husband was often
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taway and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr Duffy had many
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topportunities of enjoying the lady’s society. Neither he nor she had had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle by little he entangled his thoughts with hers. He lent her books,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprovided her with ideas, shared his intellectual life with her. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistened to all.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife. With almost maternal solicitude she urged him to let his nature
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topen to the full: she became his confessor. He told her that for some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime he had assisted at the meetings of an Irish Socialist Party where
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta garret lit by an inefficient oil-lamp. When the party had divided into
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthree sections, each under its own leader and in its own garret, he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscontinued his attendances. The workmen’s discussions, he said,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere too timorous; the interest they took in the question of wages was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinordinate. He felt that they were hard-featured realists and that they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresented an exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not within
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir reach. No social revolution, he told her, would be likely to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrike Dublin for some centuries.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe asked him why did he not write out his thoughts. For what, he asked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther, with careful scorn. To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthinking consecutively for sixty seconds? To submit himself to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcriticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted its morality to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpolicemen and its fine arts to impresarios?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went often to her little cottage outside Dublin; often they spent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir evenings alone. Little by little, as their thoughts entangled,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey spoke of subjects less remote. Her companionship was like a warm
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoil about an exotic. Many times she allowed the dark to fall upon
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem, refraining from lighting the lamp. The dark discreet room, their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tisolation, the music that still vibrated in their ears united them.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis union exalted him, wore away the rough edges of his character,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\temotionalised his mental life. Sometimes he caught himself listening to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sound of his own voice. He thought that in her eyes he would ascend
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompanion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul’s incurable
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloneliness. We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. The end
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsign of unusual excitement, Mrs Sinico caught up his hand passionately
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand pressed it to her cheek.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Duffy was very much surprised. Her interpretation of his words
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisillusioned him. He did not visit her for a week, then he wrote to her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasking her to meet him. As he did not wish their last interview to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttroubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle cakeshop near the Parkgate. It was cold autumn weather but in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the Park for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnearly three hours. They agreed to break off their intercourse: every
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbond, he said, is a bond to sorrow. When they came out of the Park they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked in silence towards the tram; but here she began to tremble
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso violently that, fearing another collapse on her part, he bade her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood-bye quickly and left her. A few days later he received a parcel
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontaining his books and music.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFour years passed. Mr Duffy returned to his even way of life. His room
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill bore witness of the orderliness of his mind. Some new pieces of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusic encumbered the music-stand in the lower room and on his shelves
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood two volumes by Nietzsche: _Thus Spake Zarathustra_ and _The Gay
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tScience_. He wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his desk.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne of his sentences, written two months after his last interview with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Sinico, read: Love between man and man is impossible because there
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmust not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpossible because there must be sexual intercourse. He kept away from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcerts lest he should meet her. His father died; the junior partner of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bank retired. And still every morning he went into the city by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoderately in George’s Street and read the evening paper for dessert.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne evening as he was about to put a morsel of corned beef and cabbage
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto his mouth his hand stopped. His eyes fixed themselves on a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparagraph in the evening paper which he had propped against the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twater-carafe. He replaced the morsel of food on his plate and read the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparagraph attentively. Then he drank a glass of water, pushed his plate
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto one side, doubled the paper down before him between his elbows and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tread the paragraph over and over again. The cabbage began to deposit a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcold white grease on his plate. The girl came over to him to ask was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this dinner not properly cooked. He said it was very good and ate a few
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouthfuls of it with difficulty. Then he paid his bill and went out.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked along quickly through the November twilight, his stout hazel
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstick striking the ground regularly, the fringe of the buff _Mail_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeeping out of a side-pocket of his tight reefer overcoat. On the lonely
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troad which leads from the Parkgate to Chapelizod he slackened his pace.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath, issuing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tirregularly, almost with a sighing sound, condensed in the wintry air.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom and, taking
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe paper from his pocket, read the paragraph again by the failing light
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the window. He read it not aloud, but moving his lips as a priest
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoes when he reads the prayers _Secreto_. This was the paragraph:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDEATH OF A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE A PAINFUL CASE
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tToday at the City of Dublin Hospital the Deputy Coroner (in the absence
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Mr Leverett) held an inquest on the body of Mrs Emily Sinico, aged
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening. The evidence showed that the deceased lady, while attempting to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcross the line, was knocked down by the engine of the ten o’clock slow
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrain from Kingstown, thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tside which led to her death.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJames Lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he had been in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\temployment of the railway company for fifteen years. On hearing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe guard’s whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries. The train was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoing slowly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tP. Dunne, railway porter, stated that as the train was about to start he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobserved a woman attempting to cross the lines. He ran towards her and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshouted, but, before he could reach her, she was caught by the buffer of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe engine and fell to the ground.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_A juror_. “You saw the lady fall?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Witness_. “Yes.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPolice Sergeant Croly deposed that when he arrived he found the deceased
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlying on the platform apparently dead. He had the body taken to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConstable 57E corroborated.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDr Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin Hospital,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsevere contusions of the right shoulder. The right side of the head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been injured in the fall. The injuries were not sufficient to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave caused death in a normal person. Death, in his opinion, had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprobably due to shock and sudden failure of the heart’s action.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr H. B. Patterson Finlay, on behalf of the railway company, expressed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this deep regret at the accident. The company had always taken every
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprecaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboth by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent spring
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgates at level crossings. The deceased had been in the habit of crossing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lines late at night from platform to platform and, in view of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcertain other circumstances of the case, he did not think the railway
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tofficials were to blame.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCaptain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the deceased,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talso gave evidence. He stated that the deceased was his wife. He was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot in Dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning from Rotterdam. They had been married for twenty-two years and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trather intemperate in her habits.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof going out at night to buy spirits. She, witness, had often tried to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. She was not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat home until an hour after the accident. The jury returned a verdict
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblame.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter. He urged on the railway
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompany to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccidents in the future. No blame attached to anyone.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cheerless evening landscape. The river lay quiet beside the empty
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLucan road. What an end! The whole narrative of her death revolted him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld sacred. The threadbare phrases, the inane expressions of sympathy,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the details of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta commonplace vulgar death attacked his stomach. Not merely had she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdegraded herself; she had degraded him. He saw the squalid tract of her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvice, miserable and malodorous. His soul’s companion! He thought of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hobbling wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottles to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe filled by the barman. Just God, what an end! Evidently she had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunfit to live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared. But that she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould have sunk so low! Was it possible he had deceived himself
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso utterly about her? He remembered her outburst of that night and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinterpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done. He had no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifficulty now in approving of the course he had taken.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought her hand
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttouched his. The shock which had first attacked his stomach was now
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattacking his nerves. He put on his overcoat and hat quickly and went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout. The cold air met him on the threshold; it crept into the sleeves of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this coat. When he came to the public-house at Chapelizod Bridge he went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin and ordered a hot punch.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentleman’s estate in County Kildare. They drank at intervals from their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thuge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often on the floor and sometimes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots. Mr Duffy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsat on his stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing them.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a while they went out and he called for another punch. He sat a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong time over it. The shop was very quiet. The proprietor sprawled on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe counter reading the _Herald_ and yawning. Now and again a tram was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theard swishing along the lonely road outside.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs he sat there, living over his life with her and evoking alternately
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe two images in which he now conceived her, he realised that she was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead, that she had ceased to exist, that she had become a memory. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to feel ill at ease. He asked himself what else could he have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdone. He could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her; he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould not have lived with her openly. He had done what seemed to him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbest. How was he to blame? Now that she was gone he understood how
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlonely her life must have been, sitting night after night alone in that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom. His life would be lonely too until he, too, died, ceased to exist,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecame a memory--if anyone remembered him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was after nine o’clock when he left the shop. The night was cold and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgloomy. He entered the Park by the first gate and walked along under the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgaunt trees. He walked through the bleak alleys where they had walked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfour years before. She seemed to be near him in the darkness. At moments
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the seemed to feel her voice touch his ear, her hand touch his. He stood
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill to listen. Why had he withheld life from her? Why had he sentenced
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther to death? He felt his moral nature falling to pieces.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen he gained the crest of the Magazine Hill he halted and looked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong the river towards Dublin, the lights of which burned redly and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thospitably in the cold night. He looked down the slope and, at the base,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the shadow of the wall of the Park, he saw some human figures lying.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThose venal and furtive loves filled him with despair. He gnawed the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trectitude of his life; he felt that he had been outcast from life’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeast. One human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand happiness: he had sentenced her to ignominy, a death of shame. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew that the prostrate creatures down by the wall were watching him and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twished him gone. No one wanted him; he was outcast from life’s feast.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned his eyes to the grey gleaming river, winding along towards
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin. Beyond the river he saw a goods train winding out of Kingsbridge
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStation, like a worm with a fiery head winding through the darkness,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobstinately and laboriously. It passed slowly out of sight; but still
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the heard in his ears the laborious drone of the engine reiterating the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsyllables of her name.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned back the way he had come, the rhythm of the engine pounding
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin his ears. He began to doubt the reality of what memory told him. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away. He could not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeel her near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaited for some minutes listening. He could hear nothing: the night was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfectly silent. He listened again: perfectly silent. He felt that he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas alone.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIVY DAY IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOLD JACK raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem judiciously over the whitening dome of coals. When the dome was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but, as he set himself to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfan the fire again, his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this face slowly re-emerged into light. It was an old man’s face, very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbony and hairy. The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit closed. When the cinders had caught he laid the piece of cardboard
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst the wall, sighed and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s better now, Mr O’Connor.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured by many
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblotches and pimples, had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeditatively. Then he began to roll the tobacco again meditatively and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter a moment’s thought decided to lick the paper.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did Mr Tierney say when he’d be back?” he asked in a husky falsetto.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He didn’t say.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began to search his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpockets. He took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll get you a match,” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Never mind, this’ll do,” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ---------- ROYAL EXCHANGE WARD ----------
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Richard J. Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the favour of your
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvote and influence at the coming election in the Royal Exchange Ward.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t----------
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor had been engaged by Tierney’s agent to canvass one part of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ward but, as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the wet,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the Committee
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRoom in Wicklow Street with Jack, the old caretaker. They had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsitting thus since the short day had grown dark. It was the sixth of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOctober, dismal and cold out of doors.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lapel of his coat. The old man watched him attentively and then,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaking up the piece of cardboard again, began to fan the fire slowly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile his companion smoked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, yes,” he said, continuing, “it’s hard to know what way to bring
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup children. Now who’d think he’d turn out like that! I sent him to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChristian Brothers and I done what I could for him, and there he goes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboosing about. I tried to make him someway decent.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe replaced the cardboard wearily.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Only I’m an old man now I’d change his tune for him. I’d take the stick
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his back and beat him while I could stand over him--as I done many
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta time before. The mother, you know, she cocks him up with this and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s what ruins children,” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To be sure it is,” said the old man. “And little thanks you get for it,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonly impudence. He takes th’upper hand of me whenever he sees I’ve a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsup taken. What’s the world coming to when sons speaks that way to their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What age is he?” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Nineteen,” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why don’t you put him to something?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sure, amn’t I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool? ‘I won’t keep you,’ I says. ‘You must get a job for yourself.’
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut, sure, it’s worse whenever he gets a job; he drinks it all.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor shook his head in sympathy, and the old man fell silent,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgazing into the fire. Someone opened the door of the room and called
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hello! Is this a Freemasons’ meeting?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who’s that?” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What are you doing in the dark?” asked a voice.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that you, Hynes?” asked Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. What are you doing in the dark?” said Mr Hynes. advancing into the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlight of the fire.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a tall, slender young man with a light brown moustache. Imminent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and the collar of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjacket-coat was turned up.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Mat,” he said to Mr O’Connor, “how goes it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor shook his head. The old man left the hearth and, after
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which he thrust
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone after the other into the fire and carried to the table. A denuded
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom came into view and the fire lost all its cheerful colour. The walls
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the room were bare except for a copy of an election address. In the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmiddle of the room was a small table on which papers were heaped.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Has he paid you yet?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not yet,” said Mr O’Connor. “I hope to God he’ll not leave us in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlurch tonight.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes laughed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, he’ll pay you. Never fear,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I hope he’ll look smart about it if he means business,” said Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What do you think, Jack?” said Mr Hynes satirically to the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man returned to his seat by the fire, saying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It isn’t but he has it, anyway. Not like the other tinker.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What other tinker?” said Mr Hynes.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Colgan,” said the old man scornfully.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It is because Colgan’s a working-man you say that? What’s the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican--eh? Hasn’t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe working-man as good a right to be in the Corporation as anyone
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\telse--ay, and a better right than those shoneens that are always hat in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thand before any fellow with a handle to his name? Isn’t that so, Mat?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t said Mr Hynes, addressing Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I think you’re right,” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“One man is a plain honest man with no hunker-sliding about him. He goes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin to represent the labour classes. This fellow you’re working for only
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twants to get some job or other.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course, the working-classes should be represented,” said the old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The working-man,” said Mr Hynes, “gets all kicks and no halfpence. But
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit’s labour produces everything. The working-man is not looking for fat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjobs for his sons and nephews and cousins. The working-man is not going
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto drag the honour of Dublin in the mud to please a German monarch.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How’s that?” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Don’t you know they want to present an address of welcome to Edward
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRex if he comes here next year? What do we want kowtowing to a foreign
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tking?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Our man won’t vote for the address,” said Mr O’Connor. “He goes in on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Nationalist ticket.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Won’t he?” said Mr Hynes. “Wait till you see whether he will or not. I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow him. Is it Tricky Dicky Tierney?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“By God! perhaps you’re right, Joe,” said Mr O’Connor. “Anyway, I wish
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the’d turn up with the spondulics.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe three men fell silent. The old man began to rake more cinders
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether. Mr Hynes took off his hat, shook it and then turned down the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollar of his coat, displaying, as he did so, an ivy leaf in the lapel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If this man was alive,” he said, pointing to the leaf, “we’d have no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalk of an address of welcome.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s true,” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Musha, God be with them times!” said the old man. “There was some life
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin it then.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe room was silent again. Then a bustling little man with a snuffling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnose and very cold ears pushed in the door. He walked over quickly to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fire, rubbing his hands as if he intended to produce a spark from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No money, boys,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sit down here, Mr Henchy,” said the old man, offering him his chair.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, don’t stir, Jack, don’t stir,” said Mr Henchy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe nodded curtly to Mr Hynes and sat down on the chair which the old man
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvacated.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did you serve Aungier Street?” he asked Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr O’Connor, beginning to search his pockets for memoranda.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did you call on Grimes?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I did.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well? How does he stand?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He wouldn’t promise. He said: ‘I won’t tell anyone what way I’m going
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto vote.’ But I think he’ll be all right.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why so?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He asked me who the nominators were; and I told him. I mentioned Father
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBurke’s name. I think it’ll be all right.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hands over the fire at a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterrific speed. Then he said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“For the love of God, Jack, bring us a bit of coal. There must be some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleft.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man went out of the room.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s no go,” said Mr Henchy, shaking his head. “I asked the little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshoeboy, but he said: ‘Oh, now, Mr Henchy, when I see work going on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproperly I won’t forget you, you may be sure.’ Mean little tinker!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t‘Usha, how could he be anything else?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What did I tell you, Mat?” said Mr Hynes. “Tricky Dicky Tierney.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, he’s as tricky as they make ‘em,” said Mr Henchy. “He hasn’t got
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose little pigs’ eyes for nothing. Blast his soul! Couldn’t he pay
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup like a man instead of: ‘O, now, Mr Henchy, I must speak to Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFanning.... I’ve spent a lot of money’? Mean little shoeboy of hell! I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppose he forgets the time his little old father kept the hand-me-down
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshop in Mary’s Lane.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But is that a fact?” asked Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God, yes,” said Mr Henchy. “Did you never hear that? And the men
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused to go in on Sunday morning before the houses were open to buy a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaistcoat or a trousers--moya! But Tricky Dicky’s little old father
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner. Do you mind now?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’s that. That’s where he first saw the light.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he placed here and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere on the fire.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thats a nice how-do-you-do,” said Mr O’Connor. “How does he expect us
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto work for him if he won’t stump up?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I can’t help it,” said Mr Henchy. “I expect to find the bailiffs in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thall when I go home.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes laughed and, shoving himself away from the mantelpiece with the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taid of his shoulders, made ready to leave.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’ll be all right when King Eddie comes,” he said. “Well boys, I’m off
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the present. See you later. ‘Bye, ‘bye.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went out of the room slowly. Neither Mr Henchy nor the old man said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything but, just as the door was closing, Mr O’Connor, who had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstaring moodily into the fire, called out suddenly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘Bye, Joe.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the direction of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me,” he said across the fire, “what brings our friend in here?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat does he want?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘Usha, poor Joe!” said Mr O’Connor, throwing the end of his cigarette
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the fire, “he’s hard up, like the rest of us.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he nearly put
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout the fire, which uttered a hissing protest.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To tell you my private and candid opinion,” he said, “I think he’s a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman from the other camp. He’s a spy of Colgan’s, if you ask me. Just go
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround and try and find out how they’re getting on. They won’t suspect
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou. Do you twig?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, poor Joe is a decent skin,” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“His father was a decent respectable man,” Mr Henchy admitted. “Poor old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLarry Hynes! Many a good turn he did in his day! But I’m greatly afraid
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour friend is not nineteen carat. Damn it, I can understand a fellow
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing hard up, but what I can’t understand is a fellow sponging.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCouldn’t he have some spark of manhood about him?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He doesn’t get a warm welcome from me when he comes,” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Let him work for his own side and not come spying around here.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t know,” said Mr O’Connor dubiously, as he took out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigarette-papers and tobacco. “I think Joe Hynes is a straight man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe’s a clever chap, too, with the pen. Do you remember that thing he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrote...?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Some of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if you ask
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme,” said Mr Henchy. “Do you know what my private and candid opinion is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout some of those little jokers? I believe half of them are in the pay
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Castle.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s no knowing,” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, but I know it for a fact,” said Mr Henchy. “They’re Castle hacks....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI don’t say Hynes.... No, damn it, I think he’s a stroke above that....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut there’s a certain little nobleman with a cock-eye--you know the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpatriot I’m alluding to?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor nodded.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s a lineal descendant of Major Sirr for you if you like! O, the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart’s blood of a patriot! That’s a fellow now that’d sell his country
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor fourpence--ay--and go down on his bended knees and thank the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlmighty Christ he had a country to sell.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a knock at the door.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come in!” said Mr Henchy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoorway. His black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman’s collar or
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta layman’s, because the collar of his shabby frock-coat, the uncovered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuttons of which reflected the candlelight, was turned up about his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tneck. He wore a round hat of hard black felt. His face, shining with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\traindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspots indicated the cheekbones. He opened his very long mouth suddenly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O Father Keon!” said Mr Henchy, jumping up from his chair. “Is that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou? Come in!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, no, no, no!” said Father Keon quickly, pursing his lips as if he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere addressing a child.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Won’t you come in and sit down?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no, no!” said Father Keon, speaking in a discreet indulgent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvelvety voice. “Don’t let me disturb you now! I’m just looking for Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFanning....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He’s round at the _Black Eagle_,” said Mr Henchy. “But won’t you come
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin and sit down a minute?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no, thank you. It was just a little business matter,” said Father
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKeon. “Thank you, indeed.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe retreated from the doorway and Mr Henchy, seizing one of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandlesticks, went to the door to light him downstairs.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, don’t trouble, I beg!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, but the stairs is so dark.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no, I can see.... Thank you, indeed.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you right now?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All right, thanks.... Thanks.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the table. He sat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown again at the fire. There was silence for a few moments.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me, John,” said Mr O’Connor, lighting his cigarette with another
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpasteboard card.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hm?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What he is exactly?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ask me an easier one,” said Mr Henchy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Fanning and himself seem to me very thick. They’re often in Kavanagh’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether. Is he a priest at all?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mmmyes, I believe so.... I think he’s what you call a black sheep.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe haven’t many of them, thank God! but we have a few.... He’s an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunfortunate man of some kind....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And how does he knock it out?” asked Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s another mystery.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is he attached to any chapel or church or institution or----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” said Mr Henchy, “I think he’s travelling on his own account....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod forgive me,” he added, “I thought he was the dozen of stout.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is there any chance of a drink itself?” asked Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m dry too,” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I asked that little shoeboy three times,” said Mr Henchy, “would he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsend up a dozen of stout. I asked him again now, but he was leaning
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the counter in his shirt-sleeves having a deep goster with Alderman
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCowley.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why didn’t you remind him?” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I couldn’t go over while he was talking to Alderman Cowley. I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust waited till I caught his eye, and said: ‘About that little matter
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI was speaking to you about....’ ‘That’ll be all right, Mr H.,’ he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYerra, sure the little hop-o’-my-thumb has forgotten all about it.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s some deal on in that quarter,” said Mr O’Connor thoughtfully.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at Suffolk Street corner.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I think I know the little game they’re at,” said Mr Henchy. “You must
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\towe the City Fathers money nowadays if you want to be made Lord Mayor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen they’ll make you Lord Mayor. By God! I’m thinking seriously of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecoming a City Father myself. What do you think? Would I do for the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjob?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connor laughed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So far as owing money goes....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Driving out of the Mansion House,” said Mr Henchy, “in all my vermin,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Jack here standing up behind me in a powdered wig--eh?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And make me your private secretary, John.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. And I’ll make Father Keon my private chaplain. We’ll have a family
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparty.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Faith, Mr Henchy,” said the old man, “you’d keep up better style than
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome of them. I was talking one day to old Keegan, the porter. ‘And
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow do you like your new master, Pat?’ says I to him. ‘You haven’t much
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentertaining now,’ says I. ‘Entertaining!’ says he. ‘He’d live on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmell of an oil-rag.’ And do you know what he told me? Now, I declare to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod I didn’t believe him.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What?” said Mr Henchy and Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He told me: ‘What do you think of a Lord Mayor of Dublin sending out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a pound of chops for his dinner? How’s that for high living?’ says
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the. ‘Wisha! wisha,’ says I. ‘A pound of chops,’ says he, ‘coming into
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Mansion House.’ ‘Wisha!’ says I, ‘what kind of people is going at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall now?’”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt this point there was a knock at the door, and a boy put in his head.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is it?” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“From the _Black Eagle_,” said the boy, walking in sideways and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdepositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken bottles.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the basket to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe table and counted the full tally. After the transfer the boy put his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbasket on his arm and asked:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Any bottles?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What bottles?” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Won’t you let us drink them first?” said Mr Henchy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was told to ask for the bottles.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come back tomorrow,” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here, boy!” said Mr Henchy, “will you run over to O’Farrell’s and ask
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim to lend us a corkscrew--for Mr Henchy, say. Tell him we won’t keep
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit a minute. Leave the basket there.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boy went out and Mr Henchy began to rub his hands cheerfully,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well, he’s not so bad after all. He’s as good as his word, anyhow.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s no tumblers,” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, don’t let that trouble you, Jack,” said Mr Henchy. “Many’s the good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman before now drank out of the bottle.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Anyway, it’s better than nothing,” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He’s not a bad sort,” said Mr Henchy, “only Fanning has such a loan of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. He means well, you know, in his own tinpot way.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boy came back with the corkscrew. The old man opened three bottles
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand was handing back the corkscrew when Mr Henchy said to the boy:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Would you like a drink, boy?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If you please, sir,” said the boy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man opened another bottle grudgingly, and handed it to the boy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What age are you?” he asked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Seventeen,” said the boy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the old man said nothing further, the boy took the bottle and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here’s my best respects, sir,” to Mr Henchy, drank the contents, put
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Then
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the took up the corkscrew and went out of the door sideways, muttering
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome form of salutation.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s the way it begins,” said the old man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The thin edge of the wedge,” said Mr Henchy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmen drank from them simultaneously. After having drunk each placed his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottle on the mantelpiece within hand’s reach and drew in a long breath
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof satisfaction.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I did a good day’s work today,” said Mr Henchy, after a pause.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That so, John?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. I got him one or two sure things in Dawson Street, Crofton and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmyself. Between ourselves, you know, Crofton (he’s a decent chap, of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse), but he’s not worth a damn as a canvasser. He hasn’t a word
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto throw to a dog. He stands and looks at the people while I do the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHere two men entered the room. One of them was a very fat man whose blue
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tserge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping figure.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had a big face which resembled a young ox’s face in expression,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstaring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache. The other man, who was much
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyounger and frailer, had a thin, clean-shaven face. He wore a very high
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdouble collar and a wide-brimmed bowler hat.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hello, Crofton!” said Mr Henchy to the fat man. “Talk of the devil....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where did the boose come from?” asked the young man. “Did the cow
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalve?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, of course, Lyons spots the drink first thing!” said Mr O’Connor,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that the way you chaps canvass,” said Mr Lyons, “and Crofton and I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout in the cold and rain looking for votes?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why, blast your soul,” said Mr Henchy, “I’d get more votes in five
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminutes than you two’d get in a week.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Open two bottles of stout, Jack,” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How can I?” said the old man, “when there’s no corkscrew?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Wait now, wait now!” said Mr Henchy, getting up quickly. “Did you ever
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee this little trick?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the fire, put
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem on the hob. Then he sat down again by the fire and took another
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrink from his bottle. Mr Lyons sat on the edge of the table, pushed his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\that towards the nape of his neck and began to swing his legs.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Which is my bottle?” he asked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“This lad,” said Mr Henchy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hob. He was silent for two reasons. The first reason, sufficient in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\titself, was that he had nothing to say; the second reason was that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the considered his companions beneath him. He had been a canvasser for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWilkins, the Conservative, but when the Conservatives had withdrawn
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir man and, choosing the lesser of two evils, given their support to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Nationalist candidate, he had been engaged to work for Mr Tierney.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn a few minutes an apologetic “Pok!” was heard as the cork flew out of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Lyons’ bottle. Mr Lyons jumped off the table, went to the fire, took
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this bottle and carried it back to the table.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was just telling them, Crofton,” said Mr Henchy, “that we got a good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfew votes today.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who did you get?” asked Mr Lyons.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I got Parkes for one, and I got Atkinson for two, and got Ward
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Dawson Street. Fine old chap he is, too--regular old toff, old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConservative! ‘But isn’t your candidate a Nationalist?’ said he. ‘He’s a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trespectable man,’ said I. ‘He’s in favour of whatever will benefit this
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcountry. He’s a big ratepayer,’ I said. ‘He has extensive house property
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the city and three places of business and isn’t it to his own
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvantage to keep down the rates? He’s a prominent and respected
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcitizen,’ said I, ‘and a Poor Law Guardian, and he doesn’t belong to any
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparty, good, bad, or indifferent.’ That’s the way to talk to ‘em.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what about the address to the King?” said Mr Lyons, after drinking
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand smacking his lips.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Listen to me,” said Mr Henchy. “What we want in this country, as I said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto old Ward, is capital. The King’s coming here will mean an influx of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney into this country. The citizens of Dublin will benefit by it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLook at all the factories down by the quays there, idle! Look at all the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney there is in the country if we only worked the old industries, the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmills, the ship-building yards and factories. It’s capital we want.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But look here, John,” said Mr O’Connor. “Why should we welcome the King
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof England? Didn’t Parnell himself....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Parnell,” said Mr Henchy, “is dead. Now, here’s the way I look at it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHere’s this chap come to the throne after his old mother keeping him out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof it till the man was grey. He’s a man of the world, and he means
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell by us. He’s a jolly fine decent fellow, if you ask me, and no damn
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnonsense about him. He just says to himself: ‘The old one never went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto see these wild Irish. By Christ, I’ll go myself and see what they’re
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike.’ And are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriendly visit? Eh? Isn’t that right, Crofton?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Crofton nodded his head.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But after all now,” said Mr Lyons argumentatively, “King Edward’s life,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou know, is not the very....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Let bygones be bygones,” said Mr Henchy. “I admire the man personally.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe’s just an ordinary knockabout like you and me. He’s fond of his glass
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof grog and he’s a bit of a rake, perhaps, and he’s a good sportsman.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDamn it, can’t we Irish play fair?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s all very fine,” said Mr Lyons. “But look at the case of Parnell
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“In the name of God,” said Mr Henchy, “where’s the analogy between the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo cases?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What I mean,” said Mr Lyons, “is we have our ideals. Why, now, would we
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twelcome a man like that? Do you think now after what he did Parnell
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a fit man to lead us? And why, then, would we do it for Edward the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSeventh?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“This is Parnell’s anniversary,” said Mr O’Connor, “and don’t let
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus stir up any bad blood. We all respect him now that he’s dead and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone--even the Conservatives,” he added, turning to Mr Crofton.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPok! The tardy cork flew out of Mr Crofton’s bottle. Mr Crofton got up
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom his box and went to the fire. As he returned with his capture he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid in a deep voice:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Our side of the house respects him, because he was a gentleman.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Right you are, Crofton!” said Mr Henchy fiercely. “He was the only man
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat could keep that bag of cats in order. ‘Down, ye dogs! Lie down, ye
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurs!’ That’s the way he treated them. Come in, Joe! Come in!” he called
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout, catching sight of Mr Hynes in the doorway.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes came in slowly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Open another bottle of stout, Jack,” said Mr Henchy. “O, I forgot
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere’s no corkscrew! Here, show me one here and I’ll put it at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfire.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the hob.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sit down, Joe,” said Mr O’Connor, “we’re just talking about the Chief.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ay, ay!” said Mr Henchy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr Lyons but said nothing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s one of them, anyhow,” said Mr Henchy, “that didn’t renege him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy God, I’ll say for you, Joe! No, by God, you stuck to him like a man!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Joe,” said Mr O’Connor suddenly. “Give us that thing you wrote--do
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou remember? Have you got it on you?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, ay!” said Mr Henchy. “Give us that. Did you ever hear that, Crofton?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tListen to this now: splendid thing.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Go on,” said Mr O’Connor. “Fire away, Joe.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talluding but, after reflecting a while, he said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, that thing is it.... Sure, that’s old now.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Out with it, man!” said Mr O’Connor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘Sh, ‘sh,” said Mr Henchy. “Now, Joe!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes hesitated a little longer. Then amid the silence he took off
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to be rehearsing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he announced:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE DEATH OF PARNELL _6th October_ 1891
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead. O, Erin, mourn with grief and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoe For he lies dead whom the fell gang Of modern hypocrites laid low.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe lies slain by the coward hounds He raised to glory from the mire; And
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tErin’s hopes and Erin’s dreams Perish upon her monarch’s pyre.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn palace, cabin or in cot The Irish heart where’er it be Is bowed with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoe--for he is gone Who would have wrought her destiny.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe would have had his Erin famed, The green flag gloriously unfurled,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer statesmen, bards and warriors raised Before the nations of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWorld.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe dreamed (alas, ‘twas but a dream!) Of Liberty: but as he strove To
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclutch that idol, treachery Sundered him from the thing he loved.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShame on the coward, caitiff hands That smote their Lord or with a kiss
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBetrayed him to the rabble-rout Of fawning priests--no friends of his.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMay everlasting shame consume The memory of those who tried To befoul
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand smear the exalted name Of one who spurned them in his pride.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe fell as fall the mighty ones, Nobly undaunted to the last, And death
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas now united him With Erin’s heroes of the past.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo sound of strife disturb his sleep! Calmly he rests: no human pain Or
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh ambition spurs him now The peaks of glory to attain.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey had their way: they laid him low. But Erin, list, his spirit may
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRise, like the Phœnix from the flames, When breaks the dawning of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe day,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe day that brings us Freedom’s reign. And on that day may Erin well
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPledge in the cup she lifts to Joy One grief--the memory of Parnell.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Hynes sat down again on the table. When he had finished his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping: even Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLyons clapped. The applause continued for a little time. When it had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in silence.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPok! The cork flew out of Mr Hynes’ bottle, but Mr Hynes remained
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsitting flushed and bareheaded on the table. He did not seem to have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theard the invitation.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good man, Joe!” said Mr O’Connor, taking out his cigarette papers and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpouch the better to hide his emotion.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What do you think of that, Crofton?” cried Mr Henchy. “Isn’t that fine?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA MOTHER
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMR HOLOHAN, assistant secretary of the _Eire Abu_ Society, had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHolohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney who arranged everything.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Devlin had become Mrs Kearney out of spite. She had been educated
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool. When she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouses where her playing and ivory manners were much admired. She sat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamid the chilly circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto brave it and offer her a brilliant life. But the young men whom she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmet were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecret. However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarried life, Mrs Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFriday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboth his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe age of twenty-four. He sent the elder daughter, Kathleen, to a good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconvent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfees at the Academy. Every year in the month of July Mrs Kearney found
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toccasion to say to some friend:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIf it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs Kearney determined
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto take advantage of her daughter’s name and brought an Irish teacher to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe house. Kathleen and her sister sent Irish picture postcards to their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriends and these friends sent back other Irish picture postcards.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn special Sundays, when Mr Kearney went with his family to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe corner of Cathedral Street. They were all friends of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearneys--musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplayed every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to be heard often on people’s lips. People said that she was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeliever in the language movement. Mrs Kearney was well content at this.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTherefore she was not surprised when one day Mr Holohan came to her and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfour grand concerts which his Society was going to give in the Antient
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConcert Rooms. She brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treceive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcerts.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs Mr Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs Kearney helped
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. She had tact. She knew what _artistes_ should go into capitals and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat _artistes_ should go into small type. She knew that the first
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttenor would not like to come on after Mr Meade’s comic turn. To keep the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taudience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe old favourites. Mr Holohan called to see her every day to have her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvice on some point. She was invariably friendly and advising--homely,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin fact. She pushed the decanter towards him, saying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, help yourself, Mr Holohan!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd while he was helping himself she said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid of it!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEverything went on smoothly. Mrs Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharmeuse in Brown Thomas’s to let into the front of Kathleen’s dress.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis justifiable. She took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\totherwise. She forgot nothing and, thanks to her, everything that was to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe done was done.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen Mrs Kearney arrived with her daughter at the Antient Concert Rooms
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton Wednesday night she did not like the look of things. A few young men,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the vestibule;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnone of them wore evening dress. She passed by with her daughter and a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stewards’ idleness. At first she wondered had she mistaken the hour.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo, it was twenty minutes to eight.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecretary of the Society, Mr Fitzpatrick. She smiled and shook his hand.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a little man, with a white vacant face. She noticed that he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand and, while he was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. He seemed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto bear disappointments lightly. Mr Holohan came into the dressing-room
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery few minutes with reports from the box-office. The _artistes_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmirror and rolled and unrolled their music. When it was nearly half-past
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teight, the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentertained. Mr Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we’d better open the ball.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you ready, dear?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen she had an opportunity, she called Mr Holohan aside and asked him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto tell her what it meant. Mr Holohan did not know what it meant.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe said that the Committee had made a mistake in arranging for four
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcerts: four was too many.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And the _artistes_!” said Mrs Kearney. “Of course they are doing their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbest, but really they are not good.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan admitted that the _artistes_ were no good but the Committee,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs Kearney said nothing,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut, as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfew people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat she had put herself to any expense for such a concert. There was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething she didn’t like in the look of things and Mr Fitzpatrick’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvacant smile irritated her very much. However, she said nothing and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaited to see how it would end. The concert expired shortly before ten,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand everyone went home quickly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs Kearney
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaw at once that the house was filled with paper. The audience behaved
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney was taking angry note of his conduct. He stood at the edge of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In the course
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the evening, Mrs Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout Mr Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes, it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas true.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But, of course, that doesn’t alter the contract,” she said. “The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontract was for four concerts.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzpatrick. Mrs Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. She called
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsigned for four concerts and that, of course, according to the terms
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the contract, she should receive the sum originally stipulated for,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhether the society gave the four concerts or not. Mr Fitzpatrick, who
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCommittee. Mrs Kearney’s anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall she could do to keep from asking:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And who is the _Cometty_ pray?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFriday morning with bundles of handbills. Special puffs appeared in all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe evening papers, reminding the music-loving public of the treat which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas in store for it on the following evening. Mrs Kearney was somewhat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treassured, but she thought well to tell her husband part of her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuspicions. He listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter if he went with her on Saturday night. She agreed. She respected
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans over.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe night of the grand concert came. Mrs Kearney, with her husband and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta rainy evening. Mrs Kearney placed her daughter’s clothes and music
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan or Mr Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstewards was any member of the Committee in the hall and, after a great
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeirne to whom Mrs Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo anything. Mrs Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscrewed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, thank you!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle sigh and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well! We did our best, the dear knows.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe _artistes_ were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome. The bass, Mr Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblack moustache. He was the son of a hall porter in an office in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcity and, as a boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thall. From this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst-rate _artiste_. He had appeared in grand opera. One night, when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan operatic _artiste_ had fallen ill, he had undertaken the part of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe king in the opera of _Maritana_ at the Queen’s Theatre. He sang
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgallery; but, unfortunately, he marred the good impression by wiping
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas unassuming and spoke little. He said _yous_ so softly that it passed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsake. Mr Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man who
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompeted every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On his fourth trial he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely nervous and extremely
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tebullient friendliness. It was his humour to have people know what an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tordeal a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr Duggan he went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover to him and asked:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you in it too?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Duggan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Shake!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscreen to view the house. The seats were being filled up rapidly and a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She came back and spoke to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther husband privately. Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNationalist friends, Miss Healy, the contralto. An unknown solitary
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman with a pale face walked through the room. The women followed with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkeen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSomeone said that she was Madam Glynn, the soprano.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wonder where did they dig her up,” said Kathleen to Miss Healy. “I’m
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsure I never heard of her.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Healy had to smile. Mr Holohan limped into the dressing-room at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman. Mr Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam Glynn
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttook her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgaze. The shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the little cup behind her collar-bone. The noise of the hall became
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore audible. The first tenor and the baritone arrived together. They
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere both well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof opulence among the company.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be polite, her eyes followed Mr Holohan in his limping and devious
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,” she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn’t know
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything about Mr Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twasn’t his business.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why isn’t it your business?” asked Mrs Kearney. “Didn’t you yourself
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbring her the contract? Anyway, if it’s not your business it’s my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbusiness and I mean to see to it.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’d better speak to Mr Fitzpatrick,” said Mr Holohan distantly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick,” repeated Mrs Kearney. “I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the baritone. They were the _Freeman_ man and Mr O’Madden Burke. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Freeman_ man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Mansion House. He said they were to leave the report for him at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Freeman_ office and he would see that it went in. He was a grey-haired
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman, with a plausible voice and careful manners. He held an extinguished
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him. He had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot intended to stay a moment because concerts and _artistes_ bored him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsiderably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece. Miss
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHealy stood in front of him, talking and laughing. He was old enough to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturn the moment to account. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappealed to his senses. He was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor him, that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttribute. When he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O’Madden Burke will write the notice,” he explained to Mr Holohan, “and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’ll see it in.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thank you very much, Mr Hendrick,” said Mr Holohan, “you’ll see it in,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI know. Now, won’t you have a little something before you go?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t mind,” said Mr Hendrick.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottles for a few gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was Mr O’Madden
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBurke, who had found out the room by instinct. He was a suave, elderly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman who balanced his imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tumbrella. His magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he balanced the fine problem of his finances. He was widely
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trespected.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile Mr Holohan was entertaining the _Freeman_ man Mrs Kearney was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther voice. The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecome strained. Mr Bell, the first item, stood ready with his music but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe accompanist made no sign. Evidently something was wrong. Mr Kearney
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked straight before him, stroking his beard, while Mrs Kearney spoke
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto Kathleen’s ear with subdued emphasis. From the hall came sounds of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tencouragement, clapping and stamping of feet. The first tenor and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaritone and Miss Healy stood together, waiting tranquilly, but Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBell’s nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould think that he had come late.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan and Mr O’Madden Burke came into the room. In a moment Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHolohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs Kearney and spoke with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlouder. Mr Holohan became very red and excited. He spoke volubly, but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kearney said curtly at intervals:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She won’t go on. She must get her eight guineas.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclapping and stamping. He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe point of her new shoe: it was not her fault. Mrs Kearney repeated:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She won’t go on without her money.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a swift struggle of tongues Mr Holohan hobbled out in haste. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom was silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpainful Miss Healy said to the baritone:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Have you seen Mrs Pat Campbell this week?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfine. The conversation went no further. The first tenor bent his head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrontal sinus. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs Kearney.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr Fitzpatrick
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tburst into the room, followed by Mr Holohan, who was panting. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand. He counted out four
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto Mrs Kearney’s hand and said she would get the other half at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinterval. Mrs Kearney said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“This is four shillings short.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: _“Now, Mr Bell,”_ to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGlynn’s item. The poor lady sang _Killarney_ in a bodiless gasping
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes. The first
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house. Kathleen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplayed a selection of Irish airs which was generously applauded. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was deservedly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapplauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the interval,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontent.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one corner
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere Mr Holohan, Mr Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaritone, the bass, and Mr O’Madden Burke. Mr O’Madden Burke said it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney’s musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaritone was asked what did he think of Mrs Kearney’s conduct. He did
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot like to say anything. He had been paid his money and wished to be at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeace with men. However, he said that Mrs Kearney might have taken the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_artistes_ into consideration. The stewards and the secretaries debated
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thotly as to what should be done when the interval came.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I agree with Miss Beirne,” said Mr O’Madden Burke. “Pay her nothing.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn another corner of the room were Mrs Kearney and her husband, Mr Bell,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece. Mrs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their mistake.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey wouldn’t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman. But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn’t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe fooled. If they didn’t pay her to the last farthing she would make
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the _artistes_.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut what else could she do? She appealed to the second tenor who said he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought she had not been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause she was a great friend of Kathleen’s and the Kearneys had often
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinvited her to their house.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs soon as the first part was ended Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Holohan went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover to Mrs Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaid after the Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase her daughter did not play for the second part, the Committee would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsider the contract broken and would pay nothing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I haven’t seen any Committee,” said Mrs Kearney angrily. “My daughter
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas her contract. She will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe won’t put on that platform.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m surprised at you, Mrs Kearney,” said Mr Holohan. “I never thought
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou would treat us this way.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what way did you treat me?” asked Mrs Kearney.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould attack someone with her hands.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m asking for my rights.” she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You might have some sense of decency,” said Mr Holohan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Might I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI can’t get a civil answer.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You must speak to the secretary. It’s not my business. I’m a great
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I thought you were a lady,” said Mr Holohan, walking away from her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabruptly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter that Mrs Kearney’s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapproved of what the Committee had done. She stood at the door, haggard
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem. She waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thope that the secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsented to play one or two accompaniments. Mrs Kearney had to stand
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplatform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaughter’s cloak and said to her husband:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Get a cab!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went out at once. Mrs Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand followed him. As she passed through the doorway she stopped and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglared into Mr Holohan’s face.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m not done with you yet,” she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But I’m done with you,” said Mr Holohan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr Holohan began to pace up and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown the room, in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s a nice lady!” he said. “O, she’s a nice lady!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You did the proper thing, Holohan,” said Mr O’Madden Burke, poised upon
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this umbrella in approval.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGRACE
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTWO gentlemen who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him up:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut he was quite helpless. He lay curled up at the foot of the stairs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown which he had fallen. They succeeded in turning him over. His hat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with the filth
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand ooze of the floor on which he had lain, face downwards. His eyes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere closed and he breathed with a grunting noise. A thin stream of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblood trickled from the corner of his mouth.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThese two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand laid him down again on the floor of the bar. In two minutes he was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsurrounded by a ring of men. The manager of the bar asked everyone
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho he was and who was with him. No one knew who he was but one of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Was he by himself?” asked the manager.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, sir. There was two gentlemen with him.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And where are they?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo one knew; a voice said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Give him air. He’s fainted.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically. A dark
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmedal of blood had formed itself near the man’s head on the tessellated
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfloor. The manager, alarmed by the grey pallor of the man’s face, sent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a policeman.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis collar was unfastened and his necktie undone. He opened his eyes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor an instant, sighed and closed them again. One of gentlemen who had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarried him upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand. The manager
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked repeatedly did no one know who the injured man was or where had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this friends gone. The door of the bar opened and an immense constable
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentered. A crowd which had followed him down the laneway collected
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutside the door, struggling to look in through the glass panels.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe manager at once began to narrate what he knew. The constable, a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung man with thick immobile features, listened. He moved his head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfloor, as if he feared to be the victim of some delusion. Then he drew
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff his glove, produced a small book from his waist, licked the lead of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this pencil and made ready to indite. He asked in a suspicious provincial
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccent:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who is the man? What’s his name and address?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA young man in a cycling-suit cleared his way through the ring of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbystanders. He knelt down promptly beside the injured man and called for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twater. The constable knelt down also to help. The young man washed the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblood from the injured man’s mouth and then called for some brandy. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconstable repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a curate
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame running with the glass. The brandy was forced down the man’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthroat. In a few seconds he opened his eyes and looked about him. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked at the circle of faces and then, understanding, strove to rise to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this feet.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You’re all right now?” asked the young man in the cycling-suit.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sha, ‘s nothing,” said the injured man, trying to stand up.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was helped to his feet. The manager said something about a hospital
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand some of the bystanders gave advice. The battered silk hat was placed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the man’s head. The constable asked:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where do you live?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man, without answering, began to twirl the ends of his moustache.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe made light of his accident. It was nothing, he said: only a little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccident. He spoke very thickly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where do you live?” repeated the constable.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man said they were to get a cab for him. While the point was being
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdebated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a long yellow
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tulster, came from the far end of the bar. Seeing the spectacle, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalled out:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hallo, Tom, old man! What’s the trouble?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sha, ‘s nothing,” said the man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe new-comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then turned
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the constable, saying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s all right, constable. I’ll see him home.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe constable touched his helmet and answered:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All right, Mr Power!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Come now, Tom,” said Mr Power, taking his friend by the arm. “No bones
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbroken. What? Can you walk?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe young man in the cycling-suit took the man by the other arm and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrowd divided.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How did you get yourself into this mess?” asked Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The gentleman fell down the stairs,” said the young man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ ‘ery ‘uch o’liged to you, sir,” said the injured man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not at all.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘ant we have a little...?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not now. Not now.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the doors into
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe laneway. The manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe scene of the accident. They agreed that the gentleman must have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmissed his footing. The customers returned to the counter and a curate
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tset about removing the traces of blood from the floor.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen they came out into Grafton Street, Mr Power whistled for an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutsider. The injured man said again as well as he could:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ ‘ery ‘uch o’liged to you, sir. I hope we’ll ‘eet again. ‘y na’e is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKernan.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Don’t mention it,” said the young man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey shook hands. Mr Kernan was hoisted on to the car and, while Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPower was giving directions to the carman, he expressed his gratitude
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the young man and regretted that they could not have a little drink
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Another time,” said the young man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe car drove off towards Westmoreland Street. As it passed Ballast
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOffice the clock showed half-past nine. A keen east wind hit them,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblowing from the mouth of the river. Mr Kernan was huddled together with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcold. His friend asked him to tell how the accident had happened.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I ‘an’t, ‘an,” he answered, “‘y ‘ongue is hurt.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Show.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe other leaned over the well of the car and peered into Mr Kernan’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouth but he could not see. He struck a match and, sheltering it in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshell of his hands, peered again into the mouth which Mr Kernan opened
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobediently. The swaying movement of the car brought the match to and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the opened mouth. The lower teeth and gums were covered with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclotted blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbitten off. The match was blown out.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s ugly,” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Sha, ‘s nothing,” said Mr Kernan, closing his mouth and pulling the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollar of his filthy coat across his neck.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dignity of its calling. He had never been seen in the city without
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters. By grace of these
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo articles of clothing, he said, a man could always pass muster. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarried on the tradition of his Napoleon, the great Blackwhite, whose
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmemory he evoked at times by legend and mimicry. Modern business methods
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in Crowe
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStreet on the window blind of which was written the name of his firm
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the address--London, E.C. On the mantelpiece of this little office
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of a black liquid. From these bowls Mr Kernan tasted tea. He took
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta mouthful, drew it up, saturated his palate with it and then spat it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforth into the grate. Then he paused to judge.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power, a much younger man, was employed in the Royal Irish
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConstabulary Office in Dublin Castle. The arc of his social rise
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintersected the arc of his friend’s decline, but Mr Kernan’s decline was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who had known him at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this highest point of success still esteemed him as a character. Mr Power
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas one of these friends. His inexplicable debts were a byword in his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcircle; he was a debonair young man.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe car halted before a small house on the Glasnevin road and Mr Kernan
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas helped into the house. His wife put him to bed while Mr Power sat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdownstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand what book they were in. The children--two girls and a boy, conscious
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof their father’s helplessness and of their mother’s absence, began
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome horseplay with him. He was surprised at their manners and at their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccents, and his brow grew thoughtful. After a while Mrs Kernan entered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe kitchen, exclaiming:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Such a sight! O, he’ll do for himself one day and that’s the holy alls
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof it. He’s been drinking since Friday.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible, that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had come on the scene by the merest accident. Mrs Kernan, remembering
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power’s good offices during domestic quarrels, as well as many small,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut opportune loans, said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, you needn’t tell me that, Mr Power. I know you’re a friend of his,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot like some of the others he does be with. They’re all right so long
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and family.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNice friends! Who was he with tonight, I’d like to know?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power shook his head but said nothing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m so sorry,” she continued, “that I’ve nothing in the house to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffer you. But if you wait a minute I’ll send round to Fogarty’s at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorner.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power stood up.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We were waiting for him to come home with the money. He never seems to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthink he has a home at all.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, now, Mrs Kernan,” said Mr Power, “we’ll make him turn over a new
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaf. I’ll talk to Martin. He’s the man. We’ll come here one of these
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnights and talk it over.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe saw him to the door. The carman was stamping up and down the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfootpath, and swinging his arms to warm himself.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s very kind of you to bring him home,” she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not at all,” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe got up on the car. As it drove off he raised his hat to her gaily.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We’ll make a new man of him,” he said. “Good-night, Mrs Kernan.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan’s puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of sight.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen she withdrew them, went into the house and emptied her husband’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpockets.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was an active, practical woman of middle age. Not long before she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her intimacy with her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thusband by waltzing with him to Mr Power’s accompaniment. In her days
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof courtship Mr Kernan had seemed to her a not ungallant figure: and she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseeing the bridal pair, recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the Star of the Sea Church in Sandymount, leaning on the arm of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta jovial well-fed man, who was dressed smartly in a frock-coat and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlavender trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother arm. After three weeks she had found a wife’s life irksome and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlater on, when she was beginning to find it unbearable, she had become a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmother. The part of mother presented to her no insuperable difficulties
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand for twenty-five years she had kept house shrewdly for her husband.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer two eldest sons were launched. One was in a draper’s shop in Glasgow
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the other was clerk to a tea-merchant in Belfast. They were good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsons, wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money. The other children
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere still at school.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade beef-tea for him and scolded him roundly. She accepted his frequent
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintemperance as part of the climate, healed him dutifully whenever he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sick and always tried to make him eat a breakfast. There were worse
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thusbands. He had never been violent since the boys had grown up and she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew that he would walk to the end of Thomas Street and back again to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbook even a small order.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo nights after his friends came to see him. She brought them up to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this bedroom, the air of which was impregnated with a personal odour,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand gave them chairs at the fire. Mr Kernan’s tongue, the occasional
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstinging pain of which had made him somewhat irritable during the day,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecame more polite. He sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle colour in his puffy cheeks made them resemble warm cinders. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapologised to his guests for the disorder of the room, but at the same
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime looked at them a little proudly, with a veteran’s pride.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriends, Mr Cunningham, Mr M’Coy and Mr Power had disclosed to Mrs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKernan in the parlour. The idea had been Mr Power’s but its development
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas entrusted to Mr Cunningham. Mr Kernan came of Protestant stock and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough he had been converted to the Catholic faith at the time of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarriage, he had not been in the pale of the Church for twenty years. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas fond, moreover, of giving side-thrusts at Catholicism.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham was the very man for such a case. He was an elder
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcolleague of Mr Power. His own domestic life was not very happy. People
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad great sympathy with him for it was known that he had married an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard. He had set up house
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her six times; and each time she had pawned the furniture on him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham. He was a thoroughly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsensible man, influential and intelligent. His blade of human knowledge,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnatural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpolice courts, had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof general philosophy. He was well informed. His friends bowed to his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topinions and considered that his face was like Shakespeare’s.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the plot had been disclosed to her, Mrs Kernan had said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I leave it all in your hands, Mr Cunningham.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a quarter of a century of married life, she had very few illusions
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleft. Religion for her was a habit and she suspected that a man of her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thusband’s age would not change greatly before death. She was tempted to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee a curious appropriateness in his accident and, but that she did not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twish to seem bloody-minded, she would have told the gentlemen that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan’s tongue would not suffer by being shortened. However, Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCunningham was a capable man; and religion was religion. The scheme
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmight do good and, at least, it could do no harm. Her beliefs were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot extravagant. She believed steadily in the Sacred Heart as the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmost generally useful of all Catholic devotions and approved of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsacraments. Her faith was bounded by her kitchen but, if she was put to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit, she could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe gentlemen began to talk of the accident. Mr Cunningham said that he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad once known a similar case. A man of seventy had bitten off a piece
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso that no one could see a trace of the bite.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I’m not seventy,” said the invalid.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God forbid,” said Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It doesn’t pain you now?” asked Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr M’Coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation. His wife, who
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been a soprano, still taught young children to play the piano at low
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterms. His line of life had not been the shortest distance between two
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoints and for short periods he had been driven to live by his wits. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been a clerk in the Midland Railway, a canvasser for advertisements
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor _The Irish Times_ and for _The Freeman’s Journal_, a town traveller
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a coal firm on commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffice of the Sub-Sheriff and he had recently become secretary to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCity Coroner. His new office made him professionally interested in Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKernan’s case.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Pain? Not much,” answered Mr Kernan. “But it’s so sickening. I feel as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif I wanted to retch off.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s the boose,” said Mr Cunningham firmly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” said Mr Kernan. “I think I caught a cold on the car. There’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething keeps coming into my throat, phlegm or----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mucus.” said Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It keeps coming like from down in my throat; sickening thing.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, yes,” said Mr M’Coy, “that’s the thorax.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked at Mr Cunningham and Mr Power at the same time with an air of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchallenge. Mr Cunningham nodded his head rapidly and Mr Power said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, well, all’s well that ends well.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m very much obliged to you, old man,” said the invalid.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power waved his hand.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Those other two fellows I was with----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who were you with?” asked Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A chap. I don’t know his name. Damn it now, what’s his name? Little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchap with sandy hair....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And who else?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Harford.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hm,” said Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen Mr Cunningham made that remark, people were silent. It was known
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat the speaker had secret sources of information. In this case the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmonosyllable had a moral intention. Mr Harford sometimes formed one of a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle detachment which left the city shortly after noon on Sunday with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some public-house on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutskirts of the city where its members duly qualified themselves as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_bona fide_ travellers. But his fellow-travellers had never consented
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto overlook his origin. He had begun life as an obscure financier by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlending small sums of money to workmen at usurious interest. Later on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had become the partner of a very fat short gentleman, Mr Goldberg, in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Liffey Loan Bank. Though he had never embraced more than the Jewish
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tethical code his fellow-Catholics, whenever they had smarted in person
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor by proxy under his exactions, spoke of him bitterly as an Irish Jew
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand an illiterate and saw divine disapproval of usury made manifest
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the person of his idiot son. At other times they remembered his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgood points.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wonder where did he go to,” said Mr Kernan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe wished the details of the incident to remain vague. He wished his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriends to think there had been some mistake, that Mr Harford and he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmissed each other. His friends, who knew quite well Mr Harford’s manners
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin drinking, were silent. Mr Power said again:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All’s well that ends well.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan changed the subject at once.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That was a decent young chap, that medical fellow,” he said. “Only for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, only for him,” said Mr Power, “it might have been a case of seven
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays, without the option of a fine.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, yes,” said Mr Kernan, trying to remember. “I remember now there
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a policeman. Decent young fellow, he seemed. How did it happen at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It happened that you were peloothered, Tom,” said Mr Cunningham
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgravely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“True bill,” said Mr Kernan, equally gravely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I suppose you squared the constable, Jack,” said Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power did not relish the use of his Christian name. He was not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstraight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr M’Coy had recently made
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs M’Coy to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfulfil imaginary engagements in the country. More than he resented the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgame. He answered the question, therefore, as if Mr Kernan had asked it.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe narrative made Mr Kernan indignant. He was keenly conscious of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcitizenship, wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbumpkins.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is this what we pay rates for?” he asked. “To feed and clothe these
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tignorant bostooms ... and they’re nothing else.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham laughed. He was a Castle official only during office
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thours.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How could they be anything else, Tom?” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“65, catch your cabbage!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone laughed. Mr M’Coy, who wanted to enter the conversation by any
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor, pretended that he had never heard the story. Mr Cunningham said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It is supposed--they say, you know--to take place in the depot where
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey get these thundering big country fellows, omadhauns, you know, to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrill. The sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup their plates.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe illustrated the story by grotesque gestures.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“At dinner, you know. Then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel. He takes up a wad
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave to try and catch it on their plates: 65, _catch your cabbage_.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone laughed again: but Mr Kernan was somewhat indignant still. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalked of writing a letter to the papers.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“These yahoos coming up here,” he said, “think they can boss the people.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI needn’t tell you, Martin, what kind of men they are.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham gave a qualified assent.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s like everything else in this world,” he said. “You get some bad
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tones and you get some good ones.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O yes, you get some good ones, I admit,” said Mr Kernan, satisfied.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s better to have nothing to say to them,” said Mr M’Coy. “That’s my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topinion!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan entered the room and, placing a tray on the table, said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Help yourselves, gentlemen.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power stood up to officiate, offering her his chair. She declined
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit, saying she was ironing downstairs, and, after having exchanged a nod
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Mr Cunningham behind Mr Power’s back, prepared to leave the room.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer husband called out to her:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And have you nothing for me, duckie?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, you! The back of my hand to you!” said Mrs Kernan tartly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer husband called after her:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Nothing for poor little hubby!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottles of stout took place amid general merriment.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe gentlemen drank from their glasses, set the glasses again on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable and paused. Then Mr Cunningham turned towards Mr Power and said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcasually:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“On Thursday night, you said, Jack.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thursday, yes,” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Righto!” said Mr Cunningham promptly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We can meet in M’Auley’s,” said Mr M’Coy. “That’ll be the most
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconvenient place.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But we mustn’t be late,” said Mr Power earnestly, “because it is sure
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be crammed to the doors.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We can meet at half-seven,” said Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Righto!” said Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Half-seven at M’Auley’s be it!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a short silence. Mr Kernan waited to see whether he would be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaken into his friends’ confidence. Then he asked:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What’s in the wind?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, it’s nothing,” said Mr Cunningham. “It’s only a little matter that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe’re arranging about for Thursday.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The opera, is it?” said Mr Kernan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no,” said Mr Cunningham in an evasive tone, “it’s just a little ...
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspiritual matter.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O,” said Mr Kernan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was silence again. Then Mr Power said, point blank:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To tell you the truth, Tom, we’re going to make a retreat.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, that’s it,” said Mr Cunningham, “Jack and I and M’Coy here--we’re
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall going to wash the pot.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and, encouraged by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this own voice, proceeded:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You see, we may as well all admit we’re a nice collection of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscoundrels, one and all. I say, one and all,” he added with gruff
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharity and turning to Mr Power. “Own up now!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I own up,” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And I own up,” said Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So we’re going to wash the pot together,” said Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA thought seemed to strike him. He turned suddenly to the invalid and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“D’ye know what, Tom, has just occurred to me? You night join in and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe’d have a four-handed reel.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good idea,” said Mr Power. “The four of us together.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan was silent. The proposal conveyed very little meaning to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this mind but, understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcern themselves on his behalf, he thought he owed it to his dignity
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto show a stiff neck. He took no part in the conversation for a long
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile but listened, with an air of calm enmity, while his friends
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscussed the Jesuits.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I haven’t such a bad opinion of the Jesuits,” he said, intervening at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlength. “They’re an educated order. I believe they mean well too.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They’re the grandest order in the Church, Tom,” said Mr Cunningham,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith enthusiasm. “The General of the Jesuits stands next to the Pope.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s no mistake about it,” said Mr M’Coy, “if you want a thing well
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdone and no flies about it you go to a Jesuit. They’re the boyos have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfluence. I’ll tell you a case in point....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Jesuits are a fine body of men,” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s a curious thing,” said Mr Cunningham, “about the Jesuit Order.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery other order of the Church had to be reformed at some time or other
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut the Jesuit Order was never once reformed. It never fell away.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that so?” asked Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s a fact,” said Mr Cunningham. “That’s history.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Look at their church, too,” said Mr Power. “Look at the congregation
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey have.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Jesuits cater for the upper classes,” said Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course,” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Kernan. “That’s why I have a feeling for them. It’s some
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof those secular priests, ignorant, bumptious----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They’re all good men,” said Mr Cunningham, “each in his own way. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIrish priesthood is honoured all the world over.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O yes,” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent,” said Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM’Coy, “unworthy of the name.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Perhaps you’re right,” said Mr Kernan, relenting.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course I’m right,” said Mr Cunningham. “I haven’t been in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld all this time and seen most sides of it without being a judge of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharacter.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe gentlemen drank again, one following another’s example. Mr Kernan
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to be weighing something in his mind. He was impressed. He had a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh opinion of Mr Cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaces. He asked for particulars.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, it’s just a retreat, you know,” said Mr Cunningham. “Father Purdon
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis giving it. It’s for business men, you know.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He won’t be too hard on us, Tom,” said Mr Power persuasively.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Father Purdon? Father Purdon?” said the invalid.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, you must know him, Tom,” said Mr Cunningham stoutly. “Fine jolly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow! He’s a man of the world like ourselves.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah, ... yes. I think I know him. Rather red face; tall.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s the man.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And tell me, Martin.... Is he a good preacher?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Munno.... It’s not exactly a sermon, you know. It’s just kind of a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriendly talk, you know, in a common-sense way.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan deliberated. Mr M’Coy said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Father Tom Burke, that was the boy!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Father Tom Burke,” said Mr Cunningham, “that was a born orator. Did
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou ever hear him, Tom?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Did I ever hear him!” said the invalid, nettled. “Rather! I heard
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And yet they say he wasn’t much of a theologian,” said Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that so?” said Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, of course, nothing wrong, you know. Only sometimes, they say, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdidn’t preach what was quite orthodox.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ah! ... he was a splendid man,” said Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I heard him once,” Mr Kernan continued. “I forget the subject of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscourse now. Crofton and I were in the back of the ... pit, you know
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t... the----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The body,” said Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, in the back near the door. I forget now what.... O yes, it was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the Pope, the late Pope. I remember it well. Upon my word it was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmagnificent, the style of the oratory. And his voice! God! hadn’t he a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice! _The Prisoner of the Vatican_, he called him. I remember Crofton
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaying to me when we came out----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But he’s an Orangeman, Crofton, isn’t he?” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“‘Course he is,” said Mr Kernan, “and a damned decent Orangeman too. We
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twent into Butler’s in Moore Street--faith, I was genuinely moved, tell
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou the God’s truth--and I remember well his very words. _Kernan_, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid, _we worship at different altars_, he said, _but our belief is the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame_. Struck me as very well put.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s a good deal in that,” said Mr Power. “There used always to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrowds of Protestants in the chapel where Father Tom was preaching.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s not much difference between us,” said Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We both believe in----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe hesitated for a moment.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“... in the Redeemer. Only they don’t believe in the Pope and in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmother of God.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But, of course,” said Mr Cunningham quietly and effectively, “our
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treligion is _the_ religion, the old, original faith.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Not a doubt of it,” said Mr Kernan warmly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here’s a visitor for you!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who is it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr Fogarty.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, come in! come in!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA pale oval face came forward into the light. The arch of its fair
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasantly astonished eyes. Mr Fogarty was a modest grocer. He had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailed in business in a licensed house in the city because his financial
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcondition had constrained him to tie himself to second-class distillers
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand brewers. He had opened a small shop on Glasnevin Road where, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflattered himself, his manners would ingratiate him with the housewives
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the district. He bore himself with a certain grace, complimented
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle children and spoke with a neat enunciation. He was not without
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tculture.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Fogarty brought a gift with him, a half-pint of special whisky. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinquired politely for Mr Kernan, placed his gift on the table and sat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown with the company on equal terms. Mr Kernan appreciated the gift all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe more since he was aware that there was a small account for groceries
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunsettled between him and Mr Fogarty. He said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wouldn’t doubt you, old man. Open that, Jack, will you?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power again officiated. Glasses were rinsed and five small
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeasures of whisky were poured out. This new influence enlivened the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconversation. Mr Fogarty, sitting on a small area of the chair, was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspecially interested.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Pope Leo XIII.,” said Mr Cunningham, “was one of the lights of the age.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis great idea, you know, was the union of the Latin and Greek Churches.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat was the aim of his life.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in Europe,” said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power. “I mean, apart from his being Pope.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So he was,” said Mr Cunningham, “if not _the_ most so. His motto, you
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow, as Pope, was _Lux upon Lux--Light upon Light_.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no,” said Mr Fogarty eagerly. “I think you’re wrong there. It was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Lux in Tenebris_, I think--_Light in Darkness_.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O yes,” said Mr M’Coy, “_Tenebrae_.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Allow me,” said Mr Cunningham positively, “it was _Lux upon Lux_. And
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPius IX. his predecessor’s motto was _Crux upon Crux_--that is, _Cross
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon Cross_--to show the difference between their two pontificates.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe inference was allowed. Mr Cunningham continued.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Pope Leo, you know, was a great scholar and a poet.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He had a strong face,” said Mr Kernan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Cunningham. “He wrote Latin poetry.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is that so?” said Mr Fogarty.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr M’Coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintention, saying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s no joke, I can tell you.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We didn’t learn that, Tom,” said Mr Power, following Mr M’Coy’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texample, “when we went to the penny-a-week school.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There was many a good man went to the penny-a-week school with a sod of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturf under his oxter,” said Mr Kernan sententiously. “The old system was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe best: plain honest education. None of your modern trumpery....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Quite right,” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No superfluities,” said Mr Fogarty.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe enunciated the word and then drank gravely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I remember reading,” said Mr Cunningham, “that one of Pope Leo’s poems
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas on the invention of the photograph--in Latin, of course.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“On the photograph!” exclaimed Mr Kernan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe also drank from his glass.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, you know,” said Mr M’Coy, “isn’t the photograph wonderful when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou come to think of it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, of course,” said Mr Power, “great minds can see things.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“As the poet says: _Great minds are very near to madness_,” said Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFogarty.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan seemed to be troubled in mind. He made an effort to recall the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProtestant theology on some thorny points and in the end addressed Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me, Martin,” he said. “Weren’t some of the popes--of course, not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour present man, or his predecessor, but some of the old popes--not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texactly ... you know ... up to the knocker?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a silence. Mr Cunningham said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, of course, there were some bad lots.... But the astonishing thing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis this. Not one of them, not the biggest drunkard, not the most ...
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout-and-out ruffian, not one of them ever preached _ex cathedra_ a word
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof false doctrine. Now isn’t that an astonishing thing?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That is,” said Mr Kernan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, because when the Pope speaks _ex cathedra_,” Mr Fogarty explained,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“he is infallible.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I know about the infallibility of the Pope. I remember I was younger
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen.... Or was it that----?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Fogarty interrupted. He took up the bottle and helped the others to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta little more. Mr M’Coy, seeing that there was not enough to go round,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleaded that he had not finished his first measure. The others accepted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder protest. The light music of whisky falling into glasses made an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagreeable interlude.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What’s that you were saying, Tom?” asked Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Papal infallibility,” said Mr Cunningham, “that was the greatest scene
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the whole history of the Church.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How was that, Martin?” asked Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham held up two thick fingers.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“In the sacred college, you know, of cardinals and archbishops and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbishops there were two men who held out against it while the others were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall for it. The whole conclave except these two was unanimous. No! They
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldn’t have it!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ha!” said Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And they were a German cardinal by the name of Dolling ... or Dowling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t... or----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Dowling was no German, and that’s a sure five,” said Mr Power,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, this great German cardinal, whatever his name was, was one; and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other was John MacHale.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What?” cried Mr Kernan. “Is it John of Tuam?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Are you sure of that now?” asked Mr Fogarty dubiously. “I thought it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas some Italian or American.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“John of Tuam,” repeated Mr Cunningham, “was the man.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drank and the other gentlemen followed his lead. Then he resumed:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There they were at it, all the cardinals and bishops and archbishops
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom all the ends of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuntil at last the Pope himself stood up and declared infallibility a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdogma of the Church _ex cathedra_. On the very moment John MacHale, who
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been arguing and arguing against it, stood up and shouted out with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe voice of a lion: ‘_Credo!_’”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_I believe!_” said Mr Fogarty.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_Credo!_” said Mr Cunningham. “That showed the faith he had. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubmitted the moment the Pope spoke.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what about Dowling?” asked Mr M’Coy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The German cardinal wouldn’t submit. He left the church.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham’s words had built up the vast image of the church in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminds of his hearers. His deep raucous voice had thrilled them as it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuttered the word of belief and submission. When Mrs Kernan came into
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe room drying her hands she came into a solemn company. She did not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisturb the silence, but leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I once saw John MacHale,” said Mr Kernan, “and I’ll never forget it as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong as I live.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned towards his wife to be confirmed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I often told you that?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan nodded.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray’s statue. Edmund Dwyer
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGray was speaking, blathering away, and here was this old fellow,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrabbed-looking old chap, looking at him from under his bushy eyebrows.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan knitted his brows and, lowering his head like an angry bull,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglared at his wife.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God!” he exclaimed, resuming his natural face, “I never saw such an eye
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a man’s head. It was as much as to say: _I have you properly taped,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy lad_. He had an eye like a hawk.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“None of the Grays was any good,” said Mr Power.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was a pause again. Mr Power turned to Mrs Kernan and said with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabrupt joviality:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Mrs Kernan, we’re going to make your man here a good holy pious
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand God-fearing Roman Catholic.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe swept his arm round the company inclusively.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We’re all going to make a retreat together and confess our sins--and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod knows we want it badly.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t mind,” said Mr Kernan, smiling a little nervously.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction. So she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan’s expression changed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If he doesn’t like it,” he said bluntly, “he can ... do the other
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing. I’ll just tell him my little tale of woe. I’m not such a bad
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cunningham intervened promptly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We’ll all renounce the devil,” he said, “together, not forgetting his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworks and pomps.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Get behind me, Satan!” said Mr Fogarty, laughing and looking at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power said nothing. He felt completely out-generalled. But a pleased
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpression flickered across his face.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All we have to do,” said Mr Cunningham, “is to stand up with lighted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, don’t forget the candle, Tom,” said Mr M’Coy, “whatever you do.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What?” said Mr Kernan. “Must I have a candle?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O yes,” said Mr Cunningham.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, damn it all,” said Mr Kernan sensibly, “I draw the line there. I’ll
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo the job right enough. I’ll do the retreat business and confession,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand ... all that business. But ... no candles! No, damn it all, I bar
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe candles!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe shook his head with farcical gravity.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Listen to that!” said his wife.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I bar the candles,” said Mr Kernan, conscious of having created an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teffect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and fro. “I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbar the magic-lantern business.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone laughed heartily.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s a nice Catholic for you!” said his wife.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No candles!” repeated Mr Kernan obdurately. “That’s off!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe transept of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street was almost full;
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand still at every moment gentlemen entered from the side door and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirected by the lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the aisles until
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey found seating accommodation. The gentlemen were all well dressed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand orderly. The light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof black clothes and white collars, relieved here and there by tweeds,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentlemen sat in the benches, having hitched their trousers slightly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabove their knees and laid their hats in security. They sat well back
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore the high altar.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn one of the benches near the pulpit sat Mr Cunningham and Mr Kernan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the bench behind sat Mr M’Coy alone: and in the bench behind him sat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power and Mr Fogarty. Mr M’Coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace in the bench with the others and, when the party had settled down
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the form of a quincunx, he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremarks. As these had not been well received he had desisted. Even he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the religious stimulus. In a whisper Mr Cunningham drew Mr Kernan’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattention to Mr Harford, the moneylender, who sat some distance off, and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Mr Fanning, the registration agent and mayor maker of the city, who
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouncillors of the ward. To the right sat old Michael Grimes, the owner
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof three pawnbroker’s shops, and Dan Hogan’s nephew, who was up for the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjob in the Town Clerk’s office. Farther in front sat Mr Hendrick, the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchief reporter of _The Freeman’s Journal_, and poor O’Carroll, an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told friend of Mr Kernan’s, who had been at one time a considerable
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommercial figure. Gradually, as he recognised familiar faces, Mr Kernan
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to feel more at home. His hat, which had been rehabilitated by his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twife, rested upon his knees. Once or twice he pulled down his cuffs with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone hand while he held the brim of his hat lightly, but firmly, with the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother hand.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA powerful-looking figure, the upper part of which was draped with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta white surplice, was observed to be struggling into the pulpit.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSimultaneously the congregation unsettled, produced handkerchiefs and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknelt upon them with care. Mr Kernan followed the general example. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpriest’s figure now stood upright in the pulpit, two-thirds of its bulk,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrowned by a massive red face, appearing above the balustrade.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Purdon knelt down, turned towards the red speck of light
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, covering his face with his hands, prayed. After an interval, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncovered his face and rose. The congregation rose also and settled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain on its benches. Mr Kernan restored his hat to its original
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tposition on his knee and presented an attentive face to the preacher.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe preacher turned back each wide sleeve of his surplice with an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\telaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of faces. Then he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_“For the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildren of light. Wherefore make unto yourselves friends out of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teverlasting dwellings.”_
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Purdon developed the text with resonant assurance. It was one of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe most difficult texts in all the Scriptures, he said, to interpret
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproperly. It was a text which might seem to the casual observer at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvariance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by Jesus Christ.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut, he told his hearers, the text had seemed to him specially adapted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of worldlings. It
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a text for business men and professional men. Jesus Christ, with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis divine understanding of every cranny of our human nature, understood
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat all men were not called to the religious life, that by far the vast
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmajority were forced to live in the world and, to a certain extent,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the world: and in this sentence He designed to give them a word of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounsel, setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the least solicitous in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatters religious.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world speaking to his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow-men. He came to speak to business men and he would speak to them
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a businesslike way. If he might use the metaphor, he said, he was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir spiritual accountant; and he wished each and every one of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thearers to open his books, the books of his spiritual life, and see if
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey tallied accurately with conscience.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster. He understood our little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailings, understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature, understood
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe temptations of this life. We might have had, we all had from time to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime, our temptations: we might have, we all had, our failings. But one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing only, he said, he would ask of his hearers. And that was: to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstraight and manly with God. If their accounts tallied in every point to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I have verified my accounts. I find all well.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut if, as might happen, there were some discrepancies, to admit the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttruth, to be frank and say like a man:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I have looked into my accounts. I find this wrong and this wrong.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut, with God’s grace, I will rectify this and this. I will set right my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccounts.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE DEAD
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLILY, the caretaker’s daughter, was literally run off her feet. Hardly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thallway to let in another guest. It was well for her she had not to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies’
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther who had come.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan’s annual dance.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEverybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the family, the members of Julia’s choir, any of Kate’s pupils that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane’s pupils too. Never
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce had it fallen flat. For years and years it had gone off in splendid
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstyle as long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and Julia, after
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe death of their brother Pat, had left the house in Stoney Batter and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them in the dark gaunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse on Usher’s Island, the upper part of which they had rented from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor. That was a good thirty
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyears ago if it was a day. Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshort clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she had the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\torgan in Haddington Road. She had been through the Academy and gave
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta pupils’ concert every year in the upper room of the Antient Concert
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRooms. Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class families on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were, her aunts also did their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshare. Julia, though she was quite grey, was still the leading soprano
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Adam and Eve’s, and Kate, being too feeble to go about much, gave
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusic lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLily, the caretaker’s daughter, did housemaid’s work for them. Though
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir life was modest they believed in eating well; the best of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teverything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottled stout. But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders so that she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgot on well with her three mistresses. They were fussy, that was all.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut the only thing they would not stand was back answers.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas long after ten o’clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturn up screwed. They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sometimes very hard to manage him. Freddy Malins always came late
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor Freddy come.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Mr Conroy,” said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming. Good-night, Mrs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConroy.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’ll engage they did,” said Gabriel, “but they forget that my wife here
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttakes three mortal hours to dress herself.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily led
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Kate, here’s Mrs Conroy.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkissed Gabriel’s wife, said she must be perished alive and asked was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel with her.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I’ll follow,”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t called out Gabriel from the dark.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupstairs, laughing, to the ladies’ dressing-room. A light fringe of snow
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsqueaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is it snowing again, Mr Conroy?” asked Lily.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced at her. She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her look still paler.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstep nursing a rag doll.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, Lily,” he answered, “and I think we’re in for a night of it.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarefully at the end of a shelf.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me, Lily,” he said in a friendly tone, “do you still go to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O no, sir,” she answered. “I’m done schooling this year and more.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, then,” said Gabriel gaily, “I suppose we’ll be going to your wedding
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone of these fine days with your young man, eh?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbitterness:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel coloured as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuffler at his patent-leather shoes.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was a stout tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks pushed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupwards even to his forehead where it scattered itself in a few formless
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpatches of pale red; and on his hairless face there scintillated
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trestlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich screened his delicate and restless eyes. His glossy black hair was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. Then he took a coin
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trapidly from his pocket.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O Lily,” he said, thrusting it into her hands, “it’s Christmas-time,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tisn’t it? Just ... here’s a little....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked rapidly towards the door.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O no, sir!” cried the girl, following him. “Really, sir, I wouldn’t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake it.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Christmas-time! Christmas-time!” said Gabriel, almost trotting to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, thank you, sir.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeet. He was still discomposed by the girl’s bitter and sudden retort.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas undecided about the lines from Robert Browning for he feared they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be above the heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindelicate clacking of the men’s heels and the shuffling of their soles
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonly make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould not understand. They would think that he was airing his superior
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teducation. He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His whole speech was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmistake from first to last, an utter failure.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJust then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies’ dressing-room.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis aunts were two small plainly dressed old women. Aunt Julia was an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinch or so the taller. Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her large flaccid
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface. Though she was stout in build and stood erect her slow eyes and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe was or where she was going. Aunt Kate was more vivacious. Her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface, healthier than her sister’s, was all puckers and creases, like a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway, had not lost its ripe nut colour.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey both kissed Gabriel frankly. He was their favourite nephew, the son
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J. Conroy of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPort and Docks.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta tells me you’re not going to take a cab back to Monkstown
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttonight, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” said Gabriel, turning to his wife, “we had quite enough of that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast year, hadn’t we? Don’t you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgot out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdreadful cold.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,” she said. “You can’t be too
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcareful.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But as for Gretta there,” said Gabriel, “she’d walk home in the snow if
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe were let.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Conroy laughed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Don’t mind him, Aunt Kate,” she said. “He’s really an awful bother,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat with green shades for Tom’s eyes at night and making him do the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The poor child! And
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe simply hates the sight of it!... O, but you’ll never guess what he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmakes me wear now!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadmiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand hair. The two aunts laughed heartily too, for Gabriel’s solicitude
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a standing joke with them.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Goloshes!” said Mrs Conroy. “That’s the latest. Whenever it’s wet
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderfoot I must put on my goloshes. Tonight even he wanted me to put
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem on, but I wouldn’t. The next thing he’ll buy me will be a diving
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuit.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly while Aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmile soon faded from Aunt Julia’s face and her mirthless eyes were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirected towards her nephew’s face. After a pause she asked:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what are goloshes, Gabriel?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Goloshes, Julia!” exclaimed her sister “Goodness me, don’t you know
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat goloshes are? You wear them over your ... over your boots, Gretta,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tisn’t it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Mrs Conroy. “Guttapercha things. We both have a pair now.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel says everyone wears them on the continent.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, on the continent,” murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s nothing very wonderful but Gretta thinks it very funny because she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsays the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But tell me, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. “Of course,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou’ve seen about the room. Gretta was saying....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, the room is all right,” replied Gabriel. “I’ve taken one in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGresham.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To be sure,” said Aunt Kate, “by far the best thing to do. And the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildren, Gretta, you’re not anxious about them?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, for one night,” said Mrs Conroy. “Besides, Bessie will look after
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To be sure,” said Aunt Kate again. “What a comfort it is to have a girl
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike that, one you can depend on! There’s that Lily, I’m sure I don’t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow what has come over her lately. She’s not the girl she was at all.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point but she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbroke off suddenly to gaze after her sister who had wandered down the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, I ask you,” she said almost testily, “where is Julia going? Julia!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia! Where are you going?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblandly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here’s Freddy.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door was opened
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thurriedly and whispered into his ear:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he’s all right, and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdon’t let him up if he’s screwed. I’m sure he’s screwed. I’m sure he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMalins’ laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s such a relief,” said Aunt Kate to Mrs Conroy, “that Gabriel is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\there. I always feel easier in my mind when he’s here.... Julia, there’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tskin, who was passing out with his partner said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Julia,” said Aunt Kate summarily, “and here’s Mr Browne and Miss
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFurlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’m the man for the ladies,” said Mr Browne, pursing his lips until
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles. “You know, Miss
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMorkan, the reason they are so fond of me is----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tearshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmiddle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tend, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand sweets. At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstanding, drinking hop-bitters.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they said they never took
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything strong he opened three bottles of lemonade for them. Then
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the asked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdecanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky. The young
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmen eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“God help me,” he said, smiling, “it’s the doctor’s orders.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The boldest said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, now, Mr Browne, I’m sure the doctor never ordered anything of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkind.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling mimicry:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, you see, I’m like the famous Mrs Cassidy, who is reported to have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid: ‘Now, Mary Grimes, if I don’t take it, make me take it, for I feel
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI want it.’”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong, who was one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Mary Jane’s pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaltz she had played; and Mr Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpromptly to the two young men who were more appreciative.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclapping her hands and crying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Quadrilles! Quadrilles!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tClose on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, here’s Mr Bergin and Mr Kerrigan,” said Mary Jane. “Mr Kerrigan,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBergin. O, that’ll just do now.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Three ladies, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Miss Daly, you’re really awfully good, after playing for the last
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo dances, but really we’re so short of ladies tonight.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I don’t mind in the least, Miss Morkan.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But I’ve a nice partner for you, Mr Bartell D’Arcy, the tenor. I’ll get
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Lovely voice, lovely voice!” said Aunt Kate.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tled her recruits quickly from the room. They had hardly gone when Aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is the matter, Julia?” asked Aunt Kate anxiously. “Who is it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty, was of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel’s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-evening, Freddy,” said Aunt Julia.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFreddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseeing that Mr Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstory he had just told to Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He’s not so bad, is he?” said Aunt Kate to Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel’s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, no, hardly noticeable.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, isn’t he a terrible fellow!” she said. “And his poor mother made
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim take the pledge on New Year’s Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawing-room.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBefore leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr Browne by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr Browne
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, then, Teddy, I’m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust to buck you up.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFreddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taside impatiently but Mr Browne, having first called Freddy Malins’
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull glass of lemonade. Freddy Malins’ left hand accepted the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglass mechanically, his right hand being engaged in the mechanical
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treadjustment of his dress. Mr Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texploded, before he had well reached the climax of his story, in a kink
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down his untasted and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toverflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand forwards into his left eye, repeating words of his last phrase as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell as his fit of laughter would allow him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad begged Mary Jane to play something. Four young men, who had come
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpiano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes. The only
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tracing along the key-board or lifted from it at the pauses like those
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\telbow to turn the page.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel’s eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the piano. A
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpicture of the balcony scene in _Romeo and Juliet_ hung there and beside
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProbably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen taught for one year. His mother had worked for him as a birthday
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpresent a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes’ heads upon it,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons. It was strange
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther the brains carrier of the Morkan family. Both she and Julia had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister. Her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tphotograph stood before the pierglass. She held an open book on her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who, dressed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a man-o’-war suit, lay at her feet. It was she who had chosen the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife. Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, thanks to her, Gabriel himself had taken his degree in the Royal
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUniversity. A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topposition to his marriage. Some slighting phrases she had used still
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trankled in his memory; she had once spoken of Gretta as being country
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcute and that was not true of Gretta at all. It was Gretta who had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnursed her during all her last long illness in their house at Monkstown.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplaying again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toctave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trolling up her music nervously, she escaped from the room. The most
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome back when the piano had stopped.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdevice and motto.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen they had taken their places she said abruptly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I have a crow to pluck with you.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“With me?” said Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe nodded her head gravely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is it?” asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who is G. C.?” answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderstand, when she said bluntly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for _The Daily
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tExpress_. Now, aren’t you ashamed of yourself?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why should I be ashamed of myself?” asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand trying to smile.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I’m ashamed of you,” said Miss Ivors frankly. “To say you’d write
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a paper like that. I didn’t think you were a West Briton.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel’s face. It was true that he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrote a literary column every Wednesday in _The Daily Express_, for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBriton surely. The books he received for review were almost more welcome
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan the paltry cheque. He loved to feel the covers and turn over the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpages of newly printed books. Nearly every day when his teaching in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollege was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second-hand
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbooksellers, to Hickey’s on Bachelor’s Walk, to Webb’s or Massey’s on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAston’s Quay, or to O’Clohissey’s in the by-street. He did not know how
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut they were friends of many years’ standing and their careers had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparallel, first at the university and then as teachers: he could not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trisk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking his eyes and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twriting reviews of books.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a soft friendly tone:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen they were together again she spoke of the University question and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Browning’s poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Mr Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsummer? We’re going to stay there a whole month. It will be splendid out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr Clancy is coming, and Mr Kilkelly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid for Gretta too if she’d come.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe’s from Connacht, isn’t she?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Her people are,” said Gabriel shortly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But you will come, won’t you?” said Miss Ivors, laying her warm hand
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teagerly on his arm.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The fact is,” said Gabriel, “I have just arranged to go----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Go where?” asked Miss Ivors.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand so----”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But where?” asked Miss Ivors.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,” said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel awkwardly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And why do you go to France and Belgium,” said Miss Ivors, “instead of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvisiting your own land?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well,” said Gabriel, “it’s partly to keep in touch with the languages
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand partly for a change.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And haven’t you your own language to keep in touch with--Irish?” asked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Ivors.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well,” said Gabriel, “if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanguage.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTheir neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination. Gabriel
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And haven’t you your own land to visit,” continued Miss Ivors, “that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, to tell you the truth,” retorted Gabriel suddenly, “I’m sick of my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\town country, sick of it!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why?” asked Miss Ivors.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why?” repeated Miss Ivors.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIvors said warmly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course, you’ve no answer.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreat energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstart again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“West Briton!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom where Freddy Malins’ mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son’s and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof all the friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto have answered her like that. But she had no right to call him a West
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBriton before people, even in joke. She had tried to make him ridiculous
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore people, heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit’s eyes.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen she reached him she said into his ear:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gabriel, Aunt Kate wants to know won’t you carve the goose as usual.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Daly will carve the ham and I’ll do the pudding.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“All right,” said Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso that we’ll have the table to ourselves.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Were you dancing?” asked Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Of course I was. Didn’t you see me? What row had you with Molly Ivors?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No row. Why? Did she say so?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Something like that. I’m trying to get that Mr D’Arcy to sing. He’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of conceit, I think.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There was no row,” said Gabriel moodily, “only she wanted me to go for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn’t.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, do go, Gabriel,” she cried. “I’d love to see Galway again.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You can go if you like,” said Gabriel coldly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs Malins and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“There’s a nice husband for you, Mrs Malins.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile she was threading her way back across the room Mrs Malins, without
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplaces there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery. Her son-in-law
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing. Her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tson-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a beautiful big fish
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming near he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to think again about his speech and about the quotation. When he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleft the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twindow. The room had already cleared and from the back room came
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe clatter of plates and knives. Those who still remained in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawing-room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle groups. Gabriel’s warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park! The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsnow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcap on the top of the Wellington Monument. How much more pleasant it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be there than at the supper-table!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning. He repeated to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself a phrase he had written in his review: “One feels that one is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistening to a thought-tormented music.” Miss Ivors had praised the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treview. Was she sincere? Had she really any life of her own behind all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther propagandism? There had never been any ill-feeling between them
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuntil that night. It unnerved him to think that she would be at the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her critical
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquizzing eyes. Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeech. An idea came into his mind and gave him courage. He would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: “Ladies and Gentlemen, the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgeneration which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat is growing up around us seems to me to lack.” Very good: that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas one for Miss Ivors. What did he care that his aunts were only two
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tignorant old women?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA murmur in the room attracted his attention. Mr Browne was advancing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned upon his arm,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmiling and hanging her head. An irregular musketry of applause escorted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther also as far as the piano and then, as Mary Jane seated herself on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so as to pitch
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther voice fairly into the room, gradually ceased. Gabriel recognised the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprelude. It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia’s--_Arrayed for the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBridal_. Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not miss even the smallest of the grace notes. To follow the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice, without looking at the singer’s face, was to feel and share the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcitement of swift and secure flight. Gabriel applauded loudly with all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe invisible supper-table. It sounded so genuine that a little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcolour struggled into Aunt Julia’s face as she bent to replace in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusic-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her initials on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcover. Freddy Malins, who had listened with his head perched sideways to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thear her better, was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin acquiescence. At last, when he could clap no more, he stood up
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand held in both his hands, shaking it when words failed him or the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcatch in his voice proved too much for him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was just telling my mother,” he said, “I never heard you sing so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight. Now!
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWould you believe that now? That’s the truth. Upon my word and honour
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat’s the truth. I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so ... so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclear and fresh, never.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe released her hand from his grasp. Mr Browne extended his open hand
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshowman introducing a prodigy to an audience:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto him and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, Browne, if you’re serious you might make a worse discovery. All
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI can say is I never heard her sing half so well as long as I am coming
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\there. And that’s the honest truth.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Neither did I,” said Mr Browne. “I think her voice has greatly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timproved.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Thirty years ago I hadn’t a bad voice as voices go.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I often told Julia,” said Aunt Kate emphatically, “that she was simply
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrown away in that choir. But she never would be said by me.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trefractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her, a vague smile
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof reminiscence playing on her face.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” continued Aunt Kate, “she wouldn’t be said or led by anyone,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslaving there in that choir night and day, night and day. Six o’clock on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChristmas morning! And all for what?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, isn’t it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?” asked Mary Jane,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwisting round on the piano-stool and smiling.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it’s not at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboys over their heads. I suppose it is for the good of the Church if the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpope does it. But it’s not just, Mary Jane, and it’s not right.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdefence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but Mary Jane,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, Aunt Kate, you’re giving scandal to Mr Browne who is of the other
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersuasion.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate turned to Mr Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treligion, and said hastily:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I don’t question the pope’s being right. I’m only a stupid old woman
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand I wouldn’t presume to do such a thing. But there’s such a thing as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommon everyday politeness and gratitude. And if I were in Julia’s place
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’d tell that Father Healey straight up to his face....”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And besides, Aunt Kate,” said Mary Jane, “we really are all hungry and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,” added Mr Browne.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So that we had better go to supper,” said Mary Jane, “and finish the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscussion afterwards.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife and Mary
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper. But Miss Ivors,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But only for ten minutes, Molly,” said Mrs Conroy. “That won’t delay
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“To take a pick itself,” said Mary Jane, “after all your dancing.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I really couldn’t,” said Miss Ivors.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I am afraid you didn’t enjoy yourself at all,” said Mary Jane
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thopelessly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ever so much, I assure you,” said Miss Ivors, “but you really must let
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme run off now.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But how can you get home?” asked Mrs Conroy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, it’s only two steps up the quay.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel hesitated a moment and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I’ll see you home if you are really
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobliged to go.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Miss Ivors broke away from them.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I won’t hear of it,” she cried. “For goodness’ sake go in to your
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppers and don’t mind me. I’m quite well able to take care of myself.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, you’re the comical girl, Molly,” said Mrs Conroy frankly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_Beannacht libh_,” cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran down the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstaircase.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile Mrs Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing. He stared
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblankly down the staircase.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twringing her hands in despair.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where is Gabriel?” she cried. “Where on earth is Gabriel? There’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teveryone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to carve the goose!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Here I am, Aunt Kate!” cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, “ready to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarve a flock of geese, if necessary.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBetween these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\talmonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfigs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontaining port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsquads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tred labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsashes.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the goose. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Furlong, what shall I send you?” he asked. “A wing or a slice of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe breast?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Just a small slice of the breast.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Miss Higgins, what for you?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, anything at all, Mr Conroy.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpotatoes wrapped in a white napkin. This was Mary Jane’s idea and she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her and she hoped she might never eat worse. Mary Jane waited on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies. There was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreat deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst round without serving himself. Everyone protested loudly so that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarving hot work. Mary Jane settled down quietly to her supper but Aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the table, walking on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teach other’s heels, getting in each other’s way and giving each other
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunheeded orders. Mr Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppers and so did Gabriel but they said they were time enough so that,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat last, Freddy Malins stood up and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown on her chair amid general laughter.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlet him or her speak.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Very well,” said Gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdraught, “kindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminutes.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable covered Lily’s removal of the plates. The subject of talk was the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topera company which was then at the Theatre Royal. Mr Bartell D’Arcy,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe tenor, a dark-complexioned young man with a smart moustache, praised
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought she had a rather vulgar style of production. Freddy Malins said
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was a negro chieftain singing in the second part of the Gaiety
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Have you heard him?” he asked Mr Bartell D’Arcy across the table.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No,” answered Mr Bartell D’Arcy carelessly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Because,” Freddy Malins explained, “now I’d be curious to hear your
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topinion of him. I think he has a grand voice.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,” said Mr Browne
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamiliarly to the table.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And why couldn’t he have a voice too?” asked Freddy Malins sharply. “Is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit because he’s only a black?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlegitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a pass for _Mignon_.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGeorgina Burns. Mr Browne could go back farther still, to the old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tItalian companies that used to come to Dublin--Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCampanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpacked night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfive encores to _Let me like a Soldier fall_, introducing a high C every
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunyoke the horses from the carriage of some great _prima donna_ and pull
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther themselves through the streets to her hotel. Why did they never play
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe grand old operas now, he asked, _Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia?_ Because
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey could not get the voices to sing them: that was why.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Oh, well,” said Mr Bartell D’Arcy, “I presume there are as good singers
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoday as there were then.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where are they?” asked Mr Browne defiantly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“In London, Paris, Milan,” said Mr Bartell D’Arcy warmly. “I suppose
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCaruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the men
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou have mentioned.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Maybe so,” said Mr Browne. “But I may tell you I doubt it strongly.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I’d give anything to hear Caruso sing,” said Mary Jane.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“For me,” said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, “there was only
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone tenor. To please me, I mean. But I suppose none of you ever heard of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who was he, Miss Morkan?” asked Mr Bartell D’Arcy politely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“His name,” said Aunt Kate, “was Parkinson. I heard him when he was in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tput into a man’s throat.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Strange,” said Mr Bartell D’Arcy. “I never even heard of him.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,” said Mr Browne. “I remember hearing of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\told Parkinson but he’s too far back for me.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A beautiful pure sweet mellow English tenor,” said Aunt Kate with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenthusiasm.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe clatter of forks and spoons began again. Gabriel’s wife served out
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table. Midway
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The pudding was of Aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia’s making and she received praises for it from all quarters. She
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\therself said that it was not quite brown enough.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,” said Mr Browne, “that I’m brown enough for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou because, you know, I’m all brown.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith his pudding. He had been told that celery was a capital thing for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe blood and he was just then under doctor’s care. Mrs Malins, who had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen silent all through the supper, said that her son was going down to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount Melleray,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And do you mean to say,” asked Mr Browne incredulously, “that a chap
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcan go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfat of the land and then come away without paying anything?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t said Mary Jane.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,” said Mr Browne
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandidly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they did it for.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“That’s the rule of the order,” said Aunt Kate firmly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, but why?” asked Mr Browne.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr Browne still
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the sinners in the outside world. The explanation was not very clear
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor Mr Browne grinned and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I like that idea very much but wouldn’t a comfortable spring bed do
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem as well as a coffin?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The coffin,” said Mary Jane, “is to remind them of their last end.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable during which Mrs Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan indistinct undertone:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They are very good men, the monks, very pious men.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr Bartell D’Arcy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trefused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpatted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence came and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel pushed back his chair.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taltogether. Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand smiled nervously at the company. Meeting a row of upturned faces he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\traised his eyes to the chandelier. The piano was playing a waltz tune
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPeople, perhaps, were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music. The air was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpure there. In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith snow. The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ladies and Gentlemen,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeaker are all too inadequate.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, no!” said Mr Browne.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toccasion.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether under this hospitable roof, around this hospitable board. It is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot the first time that we have been the recipients--or perhaps, I had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter say, the victims--of the hospitality of certain good ladies.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe made a circle in the air with his arm and paused. Everyone laughed or
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned crimson
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith pleasure. Gabriel went on more boldly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjealously as that of its hospitality. It is a tradition that is unique
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas far as my experience goes (and I have visited not a few places
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabroad) among the modern nations. Some would say, perhaps, that with us
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of. But granted even
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust will
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong be cultivated among us. Of one thing, at least, I am sure. As long
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid--and I wish from my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart it may do so for many and many a long year to come--the tradition
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto our descendants, is still alive among us.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. It shot through
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel’s mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone away
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ladies and Gentlemen,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnew ideas and new principles. It is serious and enthusiastic for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbelieve, in the main sincere. But we are living in a sceptical and, if
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tqualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those great
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsingers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were living
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration, be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalled spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleast, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdie.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Hear, hear!” said Mr Browne loudly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But yet,” continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinflection, “there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchanges, of absent faces that we miss here tonight. Our path through
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamong the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Therefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any gloomy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoralising intrude upon us here tonight. Here we are gathered together
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe are met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_camaraderie_, and as the guests of--what shall I call them?--the Three
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGraces of the Dublin musical world.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Aunt Julia
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,” said Mary Jane.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho continued in the same vein:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Ladies and Gentlemen,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanother occasion. I will not attempt to choose between them. The task
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For when I view
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good heart,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her, or her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmust have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight, or, last
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat I do not know to which of them I should award the prize.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia’s face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate’s eyes, hastened
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Let us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprofession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour hearts.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr Browne as leader:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsingers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey sang with emphasis:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUnless he tells a lie, Unless he tells a lie.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFreddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat Aunt Kate said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Close the door, somebody. Mrs Malins will get her death of cold.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,” said Mary Jane.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Browne is everywhere,” said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary Jane laughed at her tone.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Really,” she said archly, “he is very attentive.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He has been laid on here like the gas,” said Aunt Kate in the same
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttone, “all during the Christmas.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoodness he didn’t hear me.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr Browne came in from the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoorstep, laughing as if his heart would break. He was dressed in a long
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreen overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan oval fur cap. He pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta not down yet?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“She’s getting on her things, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Who’s playing up there?” asked Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Nobody. They’re all gone.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O no, Aunt Kate,” said Mary Jane. “Bartell D’Arcy and Miss O’Callaghan
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\taren’t gone yet.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,” said Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr Browne and said with a shiver:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat. I wouldn’t like to face your journey home at this hour.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I’d like nothing better this minute,” said Mr Browne stoutly, “than a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoer between the shafts.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,” said Aunt Julia
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsadly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,” said Mary Jane, laughing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?” asked Mr Browne.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,” explained
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel, “commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman, was a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglue-boiler.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O now, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate, laughing, “he had a starch mill.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, glue or starch,” said Gabriel, “the old gentleman had a horse by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman’s mill,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking round and round in order to drive the mill. That was all very
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny. One fine day the old
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentleman thought he’d like to drive out with the quality to a military
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\treview in the park.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The Lord have mercy on his soul,” said Aunt Kate compassionately.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Amen,” said Gabriel. “So the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed Johnny
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLane, I think.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEveryone laughed, even Mrs Malins, at Gabriel’s manner and Aunt Kate
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O now, Gabriel, he didn’t live in Back Lane, really. Only the mill was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Out from the mansion of his forefathers,” continued Gabriel, “he drove
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Johnny. And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsight of King Billy’s statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKing Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyhow he began to walk round the statue.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughter of the others.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Round and round he went,” said Gabriel, “and the old gentleman, who was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. ‘Go on, sir! What
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary conduct! Can’t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderstand the horse!’”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe peal of laughter which followed Gabriel’s imitation of the incident
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door. Mary Jane ran to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\topen it and let in Freddy Malins. Freddy Malins, with his hat well back
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton his head and his shoulders humped with cold, was puffing and steaming
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter his exertions.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I could only get one cab,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, we’ll find another along the quay,” said Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes,” said Aunt Kate. “Better not keep Mrs Malins standing in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdraught.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr Browne and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter many manœuvres, hoisted into the cab. Freddy Malins clambered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat, Mr Browne
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thelping him with advice. At last she was settled comfortably and Freddy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMalins invited Mr Browne into the cab. There was a good deal of confused
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalk, and then Mr Browne got into the cab. The cabman settled his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trug over his knees, and bent down for the address. The confusion grew
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrowne, each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifficulty was to know where to drop Mr Browne along the route, and Aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter. As
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter. He popped his head in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat, and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttold his mother how the discussion was progressing, till at last Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrowne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughter:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Do you know Trinity College?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, sir,” said the cabman.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,” said Mr Browne,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“and then we’ll tell you where to go. You understand now?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, sir,” said the cabman.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Make like a bird for Trinity College.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Right, sir,” said the cabman.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchorus of laughter and adieus.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel had not gone to the door with the others. He was in a dark part
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was standing near the top
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the first flight, in the shadow also. He could not see her face but
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the could see the terracotta and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe shadow made appear black and white. It was his wife. She was leaning
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the banisters, listening to something. Gabriel was surprised at her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstillness and strained his ear to listen also. But he could hear little
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsave the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstruck on the piano and a few notes of a man’s voice singing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe voice was singing and gazing up at his wife. There was grace and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something. He asked
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto distant music, a symbol of. If he were a painter he would paint her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin that attitude. Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff the light ones. _Distant Music_ he would call the picture if he were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta painter.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown the hall, still laughing.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, isn’t Freddy terrible?” said Mary Jane. “He’s really terrible.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for them to be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent. The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice. The voice,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade plaintive by distance and by the singer’s hoarseness, faintly
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tilluminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO, the rain falls on my heavy locks And the dew wets my skin, My babe
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlies cold....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O,” exclaimed Mary Jane. “It’s Bartell D’Arcy singing and he wouldn’t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsing all the night. O, I’ll get him to sing a song before he goes.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O do, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, what a pity!” she cried. “Is he coming down, Gretta?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them. A
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfew steps behind her were Mr Bartell D’Arcy and Miss O’Callaghan.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Mr D’Arcy,” cried Mary Jane, “it’s downright mean of you to break
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I have been at him all the evening,” said Miss O’Callaghan, “and Mrs
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConroy too and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldn’t sing.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, Mr D’Arcy,” said Aunt Kate, “now that was a great fib to tell.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Can’t you see that I’m as hoarse as a crow?” said Mr D’Arcy roughly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tD’Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s the weather,” said Aunt Julia, after a pause.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, everybody has colds,” said Aunt Kate readily, “everybody.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They say,” said Mary Jane, “we haven’t had snow like it for thirty
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyears; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgeneral all over Ireland.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I love the look of snow,” said Aunt Julia sadly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“So do I,” said Miss O’Callaghan. “I think Christmas is never really
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChristmas unless we have the snow on the ground.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“But poor Mr D’Arcy doesn’t like the snow,” said Aunt Kate, smiling.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr D’Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepentant tone told them the history of his cold. Everyone gave him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this throat in the night air. Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseen her drying at the fire a few days before. She was in the same
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her. At last she turned
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Mr D’Arcy,” she said, “what is the name of that song you were singing?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s called _The Lass of Aughrim_,” said Mr D’Arcy, “but I couldn’t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremember it properly. Why? Do you know it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“_The Lass of Aughrim_,” she repeated. “I couldn’t think of the name.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It’s a very nice air,” said Mary Jane. “I’m sorry you were not in voice
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttonight.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Now, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate, “don’t annoy Mr D’Arcy. I won’t have
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim annoyed.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSeeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere good-night was said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Good-night, Aunt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJulia.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, good-night, Gretta, I didn’t see you.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Mr D’Arcy. Good-night, Miss O’Callaghan.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Miss Morkan.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, again.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, all. Safe home.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night. Good-night.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe morning was still dark. A dull yellow light brooded over the houses
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the river; and the sky seemed to be descending. It was slushy
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe parapets of the quay and on the area railings. The lamps were still
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tburning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFour Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was walking on before him with Mr Bartell D’Arcy, her shoes in a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude but Gabriel’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tveins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud, joyful,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttender, valorous.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trun after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfoolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMoments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the ivy and the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teat for happiness. They were standing on the crowded platform and he was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplacing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove. He was standing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith her in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a man making
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottles in a roaring furnace. It was very cold. Her face, fragrant in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he called out to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman at the furnace:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Is the fire hot, sir?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was just as
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell. He might have answered rudely.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin warm flood along his arteries. Like the tender fire of stars moments
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of, broke
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon and illumined his memory. He longed to recall to her those moments,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto make her forget the years of their dull existence together and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremember only their moments of ecstasy. For the years, he felt, had not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquenched his soul or hers. Their children, his writing, her household
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcares had not quenched all their souls’ tender fire. In one letter that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had written to her then he had said: “Why is it that words like
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese seem to me so dull and cold? Is it because there is no word tender
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenough to be your name?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLike distant music these words that he had written years before were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tborne towards him from the past. He longed to be alone with her. When
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe others had gone away, when he and she were in their room in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thotel, then they would be alone together. He would call her softly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPerhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing. Then
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething in his voice would strike her. She would turn and look at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim....
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad of its
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trattling noise as it saved him from conversation. She was looking out of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a few words, pointing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout some building or street. The horse galloped along wearily under the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmurky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his heels,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Gabriel was again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the boat,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgalloping to their honeymoon.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs the cab drove across O’Connell Bridge Miss O’Callaghan said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“They say you never cross O’Connell Bridge without seeing a white
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorse.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I see a white man this time,” said Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Where?” asked Mr Bartell D’Arcy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnodded familiarly to it and waved his hand.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Good-night, Dan,” he said gaily.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Mr Bartell D’Arcy’s protest, paid the driver. He gave the man a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshilling over his fare. The man saluted and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“A prosperous New Year to you, sir.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“The same to you,” said Gabriel cordially.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstanding at the curbstone, bidding the others good-night. She leaned
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced with him a few
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thours before. He had felt proud and happy then, happy that she was his,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproud of her grace and wifely carriage. But now, after the kindling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain of so many memories, the first touch of her body, musical and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrange and perfumed, sent through him a keen pang of lust. Under cover
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side; and, as they
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood at the hotel door, he felt that they had escaped from their lives
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twild and radiant hearts to a new adventure.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAn old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall. He lit a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They followed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttightly about her. He could have flung his arms about her hips and held
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpulse of his body in check. The porter halted on the stairs to settle
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this guttering candle. They halted too on the steps below him. In the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be called in the morning.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Eight,” said Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapology but Gabriel cut him short.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“We don’t want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay,” he added, pointing to the candle, “you might remove that handsome
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarticle, like a good man.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe porter took up his candle again, but slowly for he was surprised by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went out. Gabriel shot
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lock to.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA ghostly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat his emotion might calm a little. Then he turned and leaned against
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken off her hat
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and then said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlight towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary that the words
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould not pass Gabriel’s lips. No, it was not the moment yet.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You looked tired,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I am a little,” she answered.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You don’t feel ill or weak?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“No, tired: that’s all.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid abruptly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“By the way, Gretta!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What is it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You know that poor fellow Malins?” he said quickly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes. What about him?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well, poor fellow, he’s a decent sort of chap after all,” continued
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel in a false voice. “He gave me back that sovereign I lent him,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand I didn’t expect it, really. It’s a pity he wouldn’t keep away from
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat Browne, because he’s not a bad fellow, really.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something?
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIf she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst. He longed to be master of her strange mood.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“When did you lend him the pound?” she asked, after a pause.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanguage about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHenry Street.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the window. She stood before him for an instant, looking at him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“You are a very generous person, Gabriel,” she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it fine and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrilliant. His heart was brimming over with happiness. Just when he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord. Perhaps her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthoughts had been running with his. Perhaps she had felt the impetuous
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdesire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had come upon her.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered why he had been so
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiffident.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again, softly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Tell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter. Do I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of tears:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O, I am thinking about that song, _The Lass of Aughrim_.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stock-still for a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he saw it in a mirror and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalted a few paces from her and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What about the song? Why does that make you cry?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended went into his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Why, Gretta?” he asked.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And who was the person long ago?” asked Gabriel, smiling.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrandmother,” she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe smile passed away from Gabriel’s face. A dull anger began to gather
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglow angrily in his veins.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Someone you were in love with?” he asked ironically.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was a young boy I used to know,” she answered, “named Michael Furey.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe used to sing that song, _The Lass of Aughrim_. He was very delicate.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin this delicate boy.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I can see him so plainly,” she said after a moment. “Such eyes as he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them--an expression!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“O then, you were in love with him?” said Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I used to go out walking with him,” she said, “when I was in Galway.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA thought flew across Gabriel’s mind.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t he said coldly.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe looked at him and asked in surprise:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What for?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“How do I know? To see him, perhaps.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilence.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He is dead,” she said at length. “He died when he was only seventeen.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIsn’t it a terrible thing to die so young as that?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“What was he?” asked Gabriel, still ironically.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“He was in the gasworks,” she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjoy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\town clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the spoke was humble and indifferent.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,” he said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I was great with him at that time,” she said.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand said, also sadly:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I think he died for me,” she answered.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer as if, at that hour when
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst him, gathering forces against him in its vague world. But he
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaress her hand. He did not question her again for he felt that she
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould tell him of herself. Her hand was warm and moist: it did not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\trespond to his touch but he continued to caress it just as he had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaressed her first letter to him that spring morning.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“It was in the winter,” she said, “about the beginning of the winter
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen I was going to leave my grandmother’s and come up here to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconvent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldn’t be let out and his people in Oughterard were written to. He was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe paused for a moment and sighed.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Poor fellow,” she said. “He was very fond of me and he was such a
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only for
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Well; and then?” asked Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe convent he was much worse and I wouldn’t be let see him so I wrote
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsummer and hoping he would be better then.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went on:
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Then the night before I left I was in my grandmother’s house in Nuns’
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIsland, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe window was so wet I couldn’t see so I ran downstairs as I was and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe end of the garden, shivering.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And did you not tell him to go back?” asked Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeath in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a tree.”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“And did he go home?” asked Gabriel.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t“Yes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he was buried in Oughterard where his people came from. O, the day I
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theard that, that he was dead!”
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe stopped, choking with sobs and, overcome by emotion, flung herself
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was fast asleep.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad played in her life. He watched her while she slept as though he and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe had never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to say even to
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself that her face was no longer beautiful but he knew that it was no
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlonger the face for which Michael Furey had braved death.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPerhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A petticoat string
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He wondered at his riot of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\temotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt’s
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmerry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalk along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse. He had
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t_Arrayed for the Bridal_. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfind only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very soon.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart for so many years that image of her lover’s eyes when he had told
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther that he did not wish to live.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGenerous tears filled Gabriel’s eyes. He had never felt like that
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\the imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapprehend, their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity was
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich these dead had one time reared and lived in was dissolving and
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdwindling.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\this journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and,
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfarther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves.
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\thill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of
DublinersbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir last end, upon all the living and the dead.
