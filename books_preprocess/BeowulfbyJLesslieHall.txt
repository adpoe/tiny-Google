   202	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tPREFACE.
   203	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   204	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   205	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern
   206	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmeasures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. _Approximately_, I repeat; for a
   207	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tvery close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be
   208	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tprose to a modern ear.
   209	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   210	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally
   211	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\ta deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient
   212	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\treason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,
   213	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thowever, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted
   214	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tfrom the criticisms of other students of the poem.
   215	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   216	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThis work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike
   217	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he
   218	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of
   219	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tEnglish literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the
   220	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmost ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;
   221	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tand yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow
   222	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\teven a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of
   223	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tHrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the
   224	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.
   225	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   226	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tIn order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been
   227	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tused, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of
   228	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.
   229	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   230	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tPerhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf
   231	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tshould be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe
   232	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tto be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold
   233	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tto say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is
   234	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tjustly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,
   235	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tseveral have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it
   236	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tproper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and
   237	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tHrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,
   238	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tagain, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be
   239	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tinterpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear
   240	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twhat has been beautifully called "the clanging tread of a warrior in
   241	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmail"?
   242	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   243	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[viii]
   244	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   245	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tOf all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone
   246	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tgives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great
   247	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tTeutonic epic.
   248	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   249	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
   250	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\treproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences
   251	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tclosely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking
   252	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpoems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as
   253	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmuch thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular
   254	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tcadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought
   255	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthat modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has
   256	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tbeen used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some
   257	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twarrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for
   258	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tinternal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)
   259	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   260	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tWhat Gummere[1] calls the "rime-giver" has been studiously kept; _viz._,
   261	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the
   262	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\talliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only
   263	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tsporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the
   264	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\toriginal. (See 7_61, 8_5.)
   265	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   266	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tNo two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally
   267	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tafter a cæsural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,
   268	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tSievers's C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of
   269	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\ttranslation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and
   270	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\ta variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |
   271	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tx / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). Anacrusis gives
   272	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tfurther variety to the types used in the translation.
   273	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   274	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,
   275	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t1_16 and 1_17: "Lord" and "Wielder of Glory"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and
   276	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been
   277	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tsustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.
   278	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   279	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the
   280	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\ttranslation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have
   281	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tbeen avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are
   282	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tnone, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.

   285	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   286	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tWith these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of
   287	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe story of the poem.
   288	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   289	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   290	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_THE STORY._
   291	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   292	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or
   293	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpalace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.
   294	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the
   295	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmonster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of
   296	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tjoyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and
   297	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tanon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after
   298	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong
   299	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tenough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he
   300	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpersecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._
   301	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   302	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Over sea, a day's voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,
   303	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tking of the Geats, hears of Grendel's doings and of Hrothgar's misery. He
   304	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tresolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With
   305	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tfourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that
   306	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tcountry, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours
   307	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthat elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When
   308	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tHrothgar's bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling
   309	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thim that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his
   310	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpalace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._
   311	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   312	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God's anger. He seizes
   313	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tand kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.
   314	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tA fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,
   315	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tboth combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears
   316	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tGrendel's shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,
   317	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thowling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._
   318	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   319	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall
   320	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tHeorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and
   321	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\this retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._
   322	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   323	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Grendel's mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She
   324	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tis furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart
   325	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar's
   326	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tfavorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is
   327	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tcalled. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and
   328	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tgoes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the
   329	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twaters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her
   330	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tden. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal
   331	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tstruggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking
   332	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twith him Grendel's head._
   333	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   334	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar
   335	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tliterally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among
   336	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._
   337	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   338	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._
   339	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   340	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a
   341	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tdistinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._
   342	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   343	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he
   344	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thas been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried
   345	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tby a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing
   346	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tstruggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is
   347	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tinexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor
   348	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is
   349	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tburnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that
   350	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tsailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national
   351	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thero of Geatland._
   352	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
   353	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,
   354	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\this goodness of heart, and his generosity._

   360	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tof the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history
   361	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tof the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our

  1027	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] For the 'Þæt' of verse 15, Sievers suggests 'Þá' (= which). If
  1028	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    this be accepted, the sentence 'He had ... afflicted' will read: _He_
  1029	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (_i.e._ God) _had perceived the malice-caused sorrow which they,
  1030	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    lordless, had formerly long endured_.
  1031	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  1032	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] For 'aldor-léase' (15) Gr. suggested 'aldor-ceare': _He perceived
  1033	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    their distress, that they formerly had suffered life-sorrow a long
  1034	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    while_.
  1035	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  1036	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] A very difficult passage. 'Áhte' (31) has no object. H. supplies
  1037	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'geweald' from the context; and our translation is based upon this
  1038	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    assumption, though it is far from satisfactory. Kl. suggests
  1039	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'lændagas' for 'lange': _And the beloved land-prince enjoyed (had) his
  1040	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    transitory days (i.e. lived)_. B. suggests a dislocation; but this is
  1041	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    a dangerous doctrine, pushed rather far by that eminent scholar.
  1042	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  1043	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] The reading of the H.-So. text has been quite closely followed;
  1044	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    but some eminent scholars read 'séle-rædenne' for 'sele-rædende.' If
  1045	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    that be adopted, the passage will read: _Men cannot tell us, indeed,
  1046	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the order of Fate, etc._ 'Sele-rædende' has two things to support it:
  1047	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (1) v. 1347; (2) it affords a parallel to 'men' in v. 50.

  1273	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'unhælo' (120) R. suggests 'unfælo': _The uncanny creature, greedy and

  1294	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    God. (2) Hrothgar was much grieved that Grendel had not appeared

  1296	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    devastate the hall, on account of the Creator; _i.e._ God wished to
  1297	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    make his visit fatal to him.--Ne ... wisse (169) W. renders: _Nor had

  1405	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  1406	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] 'From hám' (194) is much disputed. One rendering is: _Beowulf,
  1407	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    being away from home, heard of Hrothgar's troubles, etc_. Another,
  1408	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    that adopted by S. and endorsed in the H.-So. notes, is: _B. heard
  1409	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    from his neighborhood (neighbors),_ i.e. _in his home, etc_. A third
  1410	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    is: _B., being at home, heard this as occurring away from home_. The
  1411	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    H.-So. glossary and notes conflict.
  1412	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  1413	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] 'Eoletes' (224) is marked with a (?) by H.-So.; our rendering
  1414	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    simply follows his conjecture.--Other conjectures as to 'eolet' are:
  1415	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (1) _voyage_, (2) _toil_, _labor_, (3) _hasty journey_.
  1416	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  1417	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] The lacuna of the MS at this point has been supplied by various
  1418	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    conjectures. The reading adopted by H.-So. has been rendered in the
  1419	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    above translation. W., like H.-So., makes 'ic' the beginning of a new
  1420	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    sentence, but, for 'helmas bæron,' he reads 'hringed stefnan.' This
  1421	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    has the advantage of giving a parallel to 'brontne ceol' instead of a
  1422	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    kenning for 'go.'--B puts the (?) after 'holmas', and begins a new
  1423	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    sentence at the middle of the line. Translate: _What warriors are ye,
  1424	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    clad in armor, who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the

  1427	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'on the wall' in the last sentence. If W.'s 'hringed stefnan' be
  1428	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    accepted, change line 51 above to, _A ring-stemmed vessel hither

  1797	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _where I desolated the ocean, the home of the eotens_.--This would be

  1802	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  1803	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] 'Unforhte' (444) is much disputed.--H.-So. wavers between adj. and
  1804	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    adv. Gr. and B. take it as an adv. modifying _etan: Will eat the Geats
  1805	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    fearlessly_.--Kl. considers this reading absurd, and proposes
  1806	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'anforhte' = timid.--Understanding 'unforhte' as an adj. has this
  1807	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    advantage, viz. that it gives a parallel to 'Geátena leóde': but to
  1808	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    take it as an adv. is more natural. Furthermore, to call the Geats
  1809	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'brave' might, at this point, seem like an implied thrust at the
  1810	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Danes, so long helpless; while to call his own men 'timid' would be
  1811	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    befouling his own nest.

  1814	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    translates: _Thou wilt not need my head to hide_ (i.e., thou wilt have
  1815	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    no occasion to bury me, as Grendel will devour me whole).--Simrock
  1816	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    imagines a kind of dead-watch.--Dr. H. Wood suggests: _Thou wilt not
  1817	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    have to bury so much as my head_ (for Grendel will be a thorough
  1818	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    undertaker),--grim humor.
  1819	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  1820	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [6] S. proposes a colon after 'nimeð' (l. 447). This would make no

  1822	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  1823	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [7] Owing to the vagueness of 'feorme' (451), this passage is
  1824	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    variously translated. In our translation, H.-So.'s glossary has been
  1825	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    quite closely followed. This agrees substantially with B.'s
  1826	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    translation (P. and B. XII. 87). R. translates: _Thou needst not take
  1827	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    care longer as to the consumption of my dead body._ 'Líc' is also a
  1828	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    crux here, as it may mean living body or dead body.

  3424	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] Several eminent authorities either read or emend the MS. so as to
  3425	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    make this verse read, _While Grendel was wasting the gold-bedecked
  3426	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    palace_. So 20_15 below: _ravaged the desert_.
  3427	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  3428	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] For 'sóna' (1281), t.B. suggests 'sára,' limiting 'edhwyrft.' Read
  3429	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    then: _Return of sorrows to the nobles, etc_. This emendation supplies
  3430	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the syntactical gap after 'edhwyrft.'
  3431	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  3432	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] Some authorities follow Grein's lexicon in treating 'heard ecg' as
  3433	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    an adj. limiting 'sweord': H.-So. renders it as a subst. (So v. 1491.)
  3434	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The sense of the translation would be the same.
  3435	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  3436	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] B. suggests 'under hróf genam' (v. 1303). This emendation, as well
  3437	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    as an emendation with (?) to v. 739, he offers, because 'under'
  3438	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    baffles him in both passages. All we need is to take 'under' in its
  3439	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    secondary meaning of 'in,' which, though not given by Grein, occurs in
  3440	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the literature. Cf. Chron. 876 (March's A.-S. Gram. § 355) and Oro.
  3441	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Amaz. I. 10, where 'under' = _in the midst of_. Cf. modern Eng. 'in
  3442	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    such circumstances,' which interchanges in good usage with 'under such
  3443	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    circumstances.'
  3444	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  3445	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] For 'néod-laðu' (1321) C. suggests 'néad-láðum,' and translates:

  3958	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    circulars, I tried to throw upon these two long-doubtful passages some
  3959	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    light derived from a study of like passages in Alfred's prose.--The
  3960	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    impersonal verb 'geweorðan,' with an accus. of the person, and a
  3961	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    þæt-clause is used several times with the meaning 'agree.' See Orosius

  3963	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Beowulf passages, the þæt-clause is anticipated by 'þæs,' which is
  3964	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    clearly a gen. of the thing agreed on.
  3965	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  3966	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The first passage (v. 1599 (b)-1600) I translate literally: _Then many
  3967	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    agreed upon this (namely), that the sea-wolf had killed him_.
  3968	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  3969	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The second passage (v. 2025 (b)-2027): _She is promised ...; to this
  3970	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the friend of the Scyldings has agreed, etc_. By emending 'is' instead
  3971	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    of 'wæs' (2025), the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony.

  4474	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    their vessel, welcome, etc_. (Cf. 1804.)
  4475	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  4476	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] R. suggests, 'Gewát him on naca,' and renders: _The vessel set
  4477	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    out, to drive on the sea, the Dane-country left_. 'On' bears the
  4478	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    alliteration; cf. 'on hafu' (2524). This has some advantages over the
  4479	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    H.-So. reading; viz. (1) It adds nothing to the text; (2) it makes
  4480	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'naca' the subject, and thus brings the passage into keeping with the
  4481	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    context, where the poet has exhausted his vocabulary in detailing the
  4482	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    actions of the vessel.--B.'s emendation (cf. P. and B. XII. 97) is
  4483	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    violent.
  4484	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  4485	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] B. translates: _Who for a long time, ready at the coast, had
  4486	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    looked out into the distance eagerly for the dear men_. This changes
  4487	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the syntax of 'léofra manna.'
  4488	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  4489	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] For 'wunað' (v. 1924) several eminent critics suggest 'wunade'
  4490	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (=remained). This makes the passage much clearer.
  4491	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  4492	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] Why should such a woman be described as an 'excellent' queen? C.
  4493	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    suggests 'frécnu' = dangerous, bold.
  4494	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  4495	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [6] For 'an dæges' various readings have been offered. If 'and-éges'
  4496	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    be accepted, the sentence will read: _No hero ... dared look upon her,
  4497	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    eye to eye_. If 'án-dæges' be adopted, translate: _Dared look upon her
  4498	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the whole day_.

  5036	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       75 Gleaming and wild he oft went round the cavern,

  5038	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Was seen in that desert.[6] Yet he joyed in the battle,
  5039	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Rejoiced in the conflict: oft he turned to the barrow,
  5040	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Sought for the gem-cup;[7] this he soon perceived then

  5042	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{The dragon perceives that some one has disturbed his treasure.}
  5043	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t

  5056	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          To their giver-of-gold was grievously ended.
  5057	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  5058	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] For 'long-gestréona,' B. suggests 'láengestréona,' and renders,
  5059	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _Of fleeting treasures_. S. accepts H.'s 'long-gestréona,' but
  5060	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    renders, _The treasure long in accumulating_.
  5061	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  5062	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] For 'hard-fyrdne' (2246), B. first suggested 'hard-fyndne,'
  5063	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    rendering: _A heap of treasures ... so great that its equal would be
  5064	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    hard to find_. The same scholar suggests later 'hord-wynne dæl' = _A
  5065	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    deal of treasure-joy_.
  5066	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  5067	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] Some read 'fec-word' (2247), and render: _Banning words uttered_.
  5068	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  5069	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] An earlier reading of H.'s gave the following meaning to this
  5070	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    passage: _He is said to inhabit a mound under the earth, where he,
  5071	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    etc._ The translation in the text is more authentic.
  5072	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  5073	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] The repetition of 'hord' in this passage has led some scholars to
  5074	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    suggest new readings to avoid the second 'hord.' This, however, is not
  5075	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    under the main stress, and, it seems to me, might easily be accepted.
  5076	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  5077	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [6] The reading of H.-So. is well defended in the notes to that
  5078	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    volume. B. emends and renders: _Nor was there any man in that desert
  5079	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    who rejoiced in conflict, in battle-work._ That is, the hoard-ward
  5080	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    could not find any one who had disturbed his slumbers, for no warrior
  5081	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    was there, t.B.'s emendation would give substantially the same

  5936	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    of the ancient possessor of the hoard. 'Ær gescód' (2778), translated

  6310	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] For 'góda,' which seems a surprising epithet for a Geat to apply
  6311	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    to the "terrible" Ongentheow, B. suggests 'gomela.' The passage would
  6312	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    then stand: '_The old one went then,' etc._
  6313	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6314	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] For 'segn Higeláce,' K., Th., and B. propose 'segn Higeláces,'
  6315	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    meaning: _Higelac's banner followed the Swedes (in pursuit)._--S.
  6316	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    suggests 'sæcc Higeláces,' and renders: _Higelac's pursuit._--The
  6317	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    H.-So. reading, as translated in our text, means that the banner of

  6320	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] The rendering given in this translation represents the king as
  6321	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    being generous beyond the possibility of reproach; but some
  6322	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    authorities construe 'him' (2996) as plu., and understand the passage
  6323	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received
  6324	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    more reward than they were entitled to.
  6325	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6326	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] The name 'Scyldingas' here (3006) has caused much discussion, and
  6327	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    given rise to several theories, the most important of which are as
  6328	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    follows: (1) After the downfall of Hrothgar's family, Beowulf was king
  6329	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    of the Danes, or Scyldings. (2) For 'Scyldingas' read
  6330	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'Scylfingas'--that is, after killing Eadgils, the Scylfing prince,
  6331	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Beowulf conquered his land, and held it in subjection. (3) M.
  6332	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    considers 3006 a thoughtless repetition of 2053. (Cf. H.-So.)
  6333	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6334	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] B. takes 'nihtes' and 'hwílum' (3045) as separate adverbial cases,
  6335	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    and renders: _Joy in the air had he of yore by night, etc_. He thinks
  6336	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed.
  6337	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6338	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [6] The parenthesis is by some emended so as to read: (1) (_He_ (i.e.
  6339	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _God_) _is the hope of men_); (2) (_he is the hope of heroes_). Gr.'s
  6340	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    reading has no parenthesis, but says: ... _could touch, unless God
  6341	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    himself, true king of victories, gave to whom he would to open the
  6342	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    treasure, the secret place of enchanters, etc_. The last is rejected

  6455	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] The passage 'Wundur ... búan' (3063-3066), M. took to be a

  6459	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    from old age, but should find death in the performance of some deed of
  6460	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    daring.--S. sees an indirect question introduced by 'hwár' and
  6461	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    dependent upon 'wundur': _A secret is it when the hero is to die,
  6462	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    etc_.--Why may the two clauses not be parallel, and the whole passage

  6566	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tSeveral discrepancies and other oversights have been noticed in the H.-So.
  6567	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tglossary. Of these a good part were avoided by Harrison and Sharp, the
  6568	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tAmerican editors of Beowulf, in their last edition, 1888. The rest will, I
  6569	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thope, be noticed in their fourth edition. As, however, this book may fall
  6570	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tinto the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems
  6571	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tbest to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.
  6572	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6573	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~From hám~ (194).--Notes and glossary conflict; the latter not having been

  6576	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Þær gelýfan sceal dryhtnes dóme~ (440).--Under 'dóm' H. says 'the might
  6577	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tof the Lord'; while under 'gelýfan' he says 'the judgment of the Lord.'
  6578	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6579	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Eal bencþelu~ (486).--Under 'benc-þelu' H. says _nom. plu._; while under

  6581	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6582	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Heatho-ræmas~ (519).--Under 'ætberan' H. translates 'to the Heathoremes';
  6583	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twhile under 'Heatho-ræmas' he says 'Heathoræmas reaches Breca in the
  6584	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tswimming-match with Beowulf.' Harrison and Sharp (3d edition, 1888) avoid
  6585	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe discrepancy.
  6586	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6587	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Fáh féond-scaða~ (554).--Under 'féond-scaða' H. says 'a gleaming

  6589	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6590	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Onfeng hraðe inwit-þancum~ (749).--Under 'onfón' H. says 'he _received_

  6594	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Níð-wundor séon~ (1366).--Under 'níð-wundor' H. calls this word itself
  6595	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_nom. sing._; under 'séon' he translates it as accus. sing., understanding
  6596	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t'man' as subject of 'séon.' H. and S. (3d edition) make the correction.
  6597	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6598	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Forgeaf hilde-bille~ (1521).--H., under the second word, calls it instr.

  6607	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6608	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Yðelíce~ (1557).--Under this word H. makes it modify 'ástód.' If this be
  6609	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tright, the punctuation of the fifth edition is wrong. See H. and S.,
  6610	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tappendix.
  6611	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6612	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Sélran gesóhte~ (1840).--Under 'sél' and 'gesécan' H. calls these two
  6613	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twords accus. plu.; but this is clearly an error, as both are nom. plu.,
  6614	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpred. nom. H. and S. correct under 'sél.'
  6615	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6616	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Wið sylfne~ (1978).--Under 'wið' and 'gesittan' H. says 'wið = near, by';

  6620	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6621	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~For duguðum~ (2502).--Under 'duguð' H. translates this phrase, 'in
  6622	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tTüchtigkeit'; under 'for,' by 'vor der edlen Kriegerschaar.'
  6623	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6624	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~þær~ (2574).--Under 'wealdan' H. translates _þær_ by 'wo'; under 'mótan,'
  6625	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tby 'da.' H. and S. suggest 'if' in both passages.
  6626	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6627	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Wunde~ (2726).--Under 'wund' H. says 'dative,' and under 'wæl-bléate' he
  6628	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tsays 'accus.' It is without doubt accus., parallel with 'benne.'
  6629	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6630	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Strengum gebæded~ (3118).--Under 'strengo' H. says 'Strengum' = mit
  6631	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tMacht; under 'gebæded' he translates 'von den Sehnen.' H. and S. correct
  6632	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthis discrepancy by rejecting the second reading.
  6633	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
  6634	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Bronda be láfe~ (3162).--A recent emendation. The fourth edition had
  6635	BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t'bronda betost.' In the fifth edition the editor neglects to change the
