BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tPREFACE.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmeasures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. _Approximately_, I repeat; for a
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tvery close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tprose to a modern ear.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\ta deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\treason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thowever, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tfrom the criticisms of other students of the poem.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThis work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tEnglish literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmost ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tand yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\teven a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tHrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tIn order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tused, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tPerhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tshould be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tto be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tto say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tjustly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tseveral have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tproper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tHrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tagain, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tinterpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twhat has been beautifully called "the clanging tread of a warrior in
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmail"?
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[viii]
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tOf all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tgives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tTeutonic epic.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\treproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tclosely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpoems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmuch thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tcadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthat modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tbeen used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twarrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tinternal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tWhat Gummere[1] calls the "rime-giver" has been studiously kept; _viz._,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\talliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tsporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\toriginal. (See 7_61, 8_5.)
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tNo two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tafter a cæsural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tSievers's C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\ttranslation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\ta variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tx / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). Anacrusis gives
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tfurther variety to the types used in the translation.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t1_16 and 1_17: "Lord" and "Wielder of Glory"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tsustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\ttranslation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tbeen avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tnone, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[ix]
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tWith these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe story of the poem.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_THE STORY._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpalace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tThe joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmonster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tjoyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tanon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tenough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpersecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Over sea, a day's voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tking of the Geats, hears of Grendel's doings and of Hrothgar's misery. He
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tresolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tfourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tcountry, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthat elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tHrothgar's bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thim that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpalace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God's anger. He seizes
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tand kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tA fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tboth combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tGrendel's shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thowling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tHeorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\this retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Grendel's mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tis furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar's
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tfavorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tcalled. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tgoes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twaters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tden. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tstruggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twith him Grendel's head._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tliterally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tdistinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thas been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tby a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tstruggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tinexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tburnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tsailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thero of Geatland._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\this goodness of heart, and his generosity._

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tIt is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tstory of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tof the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tof the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Of fretted embossings, from far-lands brought over,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Was placed near at hand then; and heard I not ever
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       40 That a folk ever furnished a float more superbly
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          With weapons of warfare, weeds for the battle,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Many a jewel that with him must travel
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          On the flush of the flood afar on the current.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       45 And favors no fewer they furnished him soothly,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Excellent folk-gems, than others had given him
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{He leaves Daneland on the breast of a bark.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Who when first he was born outward did send him
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Lone on the main, the merest of infants:
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          And a gold-fashioned standard they stretched under heaven
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[3]    50 High o'er his head, let the holm-currents bear him,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Soothly to tell us, they in halls who reside,[4]

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] For the 'Þæt' of verse 15, Sievers suggests 'Þá' (= which). If
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    this be accepted, the sentence 'He had ... afflicted' will read: _He_
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (_i.e._ God) _had perceived the malice-caused sorrow which they,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    lordless, had formerly long endured_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] For 'aldor-léase' (15) Gr. suggested 'aldor-ceare': _He perceived
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    their distress, that they formerly had suffered life-sorrow a long
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    while_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] A very difficult passage. 'Áhte' (31) has no object. H. supplies
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'geweald' from the context; and our translation is based upon this
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    assumption, though it is far from satisfactory. Kl. suggests
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'lændagas' for 'lange': _And the beloved land-prince enjoyed (had) his
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    transitory days (i.e. lived)_. B. suggests a dislocation; but this is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    a dangerous doctrine, pushed rather far by that eminent scholar.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] The reading of the H.-So. text has been quite closely followed;
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    but some eminent scholars read 'séle-rædenne' for 'sele-rædende.' If
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    that be adopted, the passage will read: _Men cannot tell us, indeed,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the order of Fate, etc._ 'Sele-rædende' has two things to support it:
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (1) v. 1347; (2) it affords a parallel to 'men' in v. 50.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          In the dusk of the dawning, as the day was just breaking,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Was Grendel's prowess revealed to the warriors:

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{A cry of agony goes up, when Grendel's horrible deed is fully realized.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Then, his meal-taking finished, a moan was uplifted,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The long-worthy atheling, sat very woful,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{The monster returns the next night.}

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       20 Too loathsome and lasting. Not longer he tarried,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Shameless and shocking, shrinking but little
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          From malice and murder; they mastered him fully.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          He was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       25 A pleasanter place of repose in the lodges,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          A bed in the bowers. Then was brought to his notice

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] The translation is based on 'weras,' adopted by H.-So.--K. and Th.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    read 'wera' and, arranging differently, render 119(2)-120: _They knew
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    not sorrow, the wretchedness of man, aught of misfortune_.--For
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'unhælo' (120) R. suggests 'unfælo': _The uncanny creature, greedy and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    cruel, etc_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] S. rearranges and translates: _So he ruled and struggled unjustly,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] For 'syððan,' B. suggests 'sárcwidum': _Hence in mournful words it

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    passage.--'Sibbe' (154), which H.-So. regards as an instr., B. takes
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    as accus., obj. of 'wolde.' Putting a comma after Deniga, he renders:
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _He did not desire peace with any of the Danes, nor did he wish to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    remove their life-woe, nor to settle for money_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] Of this difficult passage the following interpretations among
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    others are given: (1) Though Grendel has frequented Heorot as a demon,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    he could not become ruler of the Danes, on account of his hostility to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    God. (2) Hrothgar was much grieved that Grendel had not appeared

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          What race ye belong to. Ye far-away dwellers,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Sea-faring sailors, my simple opinion
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Hear ye and hearken: haste is most fitting
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Plainly to tell me what place ye are come from."
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] 'From hám' (194) is much disputed. One rendering is: _Beowulf,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    being away from home, heard of Hrothgar's troubles, etc_. Another,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    that adopted by S. and endorsed in the H.-So. notes, is: _B. heard
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    from his neighborhood (neighbors),_ i.e. _in his home, etc_. A third
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    is: _B., being at home, heard this as occurring away from home_. The
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    H.-So. glossary and notes conflict.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] 'Eoletes' (224) is marked with a (?) by H.-So.; our rendering
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    simply follows his conjecture.--Other conjectures as to 'eolet' are:
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (1) _voyage_, (2) _toil_, _labor_, (3) _hasty journey_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] The lacuna of the MS at this point has been supplied by various
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    conjectures. The reading adopted by H.-So. has been rendered in the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    above translation. W., like H.-So., makes 'ic' the beginning of a new
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    sentence, but, for 'helmas bæron,' he reads 'hringed stefnan.' This
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    has the advantage of giving a parallel to 'brontne ceol' instead of a
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    kenning for 'go.'--B puts the (?) after 'holmas', and begins a new
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    sentence at the middle of the line. Translate: _What warriors are ye,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    clad in armor, who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    water way, hither over the seas? For some time on the wall I have been
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    coast guard, etc_. S. endorses most of what B. says, but leaves out
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'on the wall' in the last sentence. If W.'s 'hringed stefnan' be
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    accepted, change line 51 above to, _A ring-stemmed vessel hither
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    o'ersea_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] 'Seld-guma' (249) is variously rendered: (1) _housecarle_; (2)
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _home-stayer_; (3) _common man_. Dr. H. Wood suggests _a man-at-arms
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    in another's house_.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] Instead of the punctuation given by H.-So, S. proposed to insert a

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'ring-mail' and as parallel with 'gúð-byrne.' The passage would then
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    read: _The firm and hand-locked war-burnie shone, bright ring-mail,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The mighty one rose then, with many a liegeman,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          An excellent thane-group; some there did await them,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] Some render 'gif-sceattas' by 'tribute.'--'Géata' B. and Th.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    emended to 'Géatum.' If this be accepted, change '_of_ the Geatmen' to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    '_to_ the Geatmen.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] If t.B.'s emendation of vv. 386, 387 be accepted, the two lines,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'Hasten ... kinsmen' will read: _Hasten thou, bid the throng of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    kinsmen go into the hall together_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] For 420 (_b_) and 421 (_a_), B. suggests: Þær ic (on) fífelgeban
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    ýðde eotena cyn = _where I in the ocean destroyed the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    eoten-race_.--t.B. accepts B.'s "brilliant" 'fífelgeban,' omits 'on,'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    emends 'cyn' to 'hám,' arranging: Þær ic fífelgeban ýðde, eotena hám =
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _where I desolated the ocean, the home of the eotens_.--This would be
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    better but for changing 'cyn' to 'hám.'--I suggest: Þær ic fífelgeband
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (cf. nhd. Bande) ýðde, eotena cyn = _where I conquered the monster
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    band, the race of the eotens_. This makes no change except to read
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    '_fífel_' for '_fífe_.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] 'Unforhte' (444) is much disputed.--H.-So. wavers between adj. and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    adv. Gr. and B. take it as an adv. modifying _etan: Will eat the Geats
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    fearlessly_.--Kl. considers this reading absurd, and proposes
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'anforhte' = timid.--Understanding 'unforhte' as an adj. has this
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    advantage, viz. that it gives a parallel to 'Geátena leóde': but to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    take it as an adv. is more natural. Furthermore, to call the Geats
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'brave' might, at this point, seem like an implied thrust at the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Danes, so long helpless; while to call his own men 'timid' would be
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    befouling his own nest.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] For 'head-watch,' cf. H.-So. notes and cf. v. 2910.--Th.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    translates: _Thou wilt not need my head to hide_ (i.e., thou wilt have
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    no occasion to bury me, as Grendel will devour me whole).--Simrock
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    imagines a kind of dead-watch.--Dr. H. Wood suggests: _Thou wilt not
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    have to bury so much as my head_ (for Grendel will be a thorough
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    undertaker),--grim humor.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [6] S. proposes a colon after 'nimeð' (l. 447). This would make no
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    essential change in the translation.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [7] Owing to the vagueness of 'feorme' (451), this passage is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    variously translated. In our translation, H.-So.'s glossary has been
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    quite closely followed. This agrees substantially with B.'s
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    translation (P. and B. XII. 87). R. translates: _Thou needst not take
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    care longer as to the consumption of my dead body._ 'Líc' is also a
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    crux here, as it may mean living body or dead body.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t               wáere-ryhtum Þú, wine mín Béowulf,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    This means: _From the obligations of clientage, my friend Beowulf, and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    for assistance thou hast sought us_.--This gives coherence to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Hrothgar's opening remarks in VIII., and also introduces a new motive
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    for Beowulf's coming to Hrothgar's aid.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] The repetition of 'hwæðere' (574 and 578) is regarded by some
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    scholars as a defect. B. suggests 'swá Þær' for the first: _So there
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    it befell me, etc._ Another suggestion is to change the second
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'hwæðere' into 'swá Þær': _So there I escaped with my life, etc._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] Kl. suggests a period after 'determined.' This would give the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    passage as follows: _Since they no longer could see the light of the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    sun, and lowering darkness was down over all, dire under the heavens
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    shadowy beings came going around them_.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       10 His armor of iron off him he did then,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          His helmet from his head, to his henchman committed
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          His chased-handled chain-sword, choicest of weapons,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          And bade him bide with his battle-equipments.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The good one then uttered words of defiance,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       20 No battle-skill[1] has he, that blows he should strike me,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          To shatter my shield, though sure he is mighty
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[25]      In strife and destruction; but struggling by night we

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Then the brave-mooded hero bent to his slumber,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{The Geatish warriors lie down.}

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          And many a martial mere-thane attending

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Aid and comfort, that every opponent

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] Gr. understood 'gódra' as meaning 'advantages in battle.' This
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    rendering H.-So. rejects. The latter takes the passage as meaning that
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Grendel, though mighty and formidable, has no skill in the art of war.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] B. in his masterly articles on Beowulf (P. and B. XII.) rejects
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the division usually made at this point, 'Þá.' (711), usually rendered
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'then,' he translates 'when,' and connects its clause with the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    foregoing sentence. These changes he makes to reduce the number of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'cóm's' as principal verbs. (Cf. 703, 711, 721.) With all deference to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    this acute scholar, I must say that it seems to me that the poet is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    exhausting his resources to bring out clearly the supreme event on
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    which the whole subsequent action turns. First, he (Grendel) came _in
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the wan night_; second, he came _from the moor_; third, he came _to

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          He beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] Kl. suggests 'hroden' for 'háten,' and renders: _Then quickly was
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Heorot adorned within, with hands bedecked_.--B. suggests 'gefrætwon'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    instead of 'gefrætwod,' and renders: _Then was it commanded to adorn
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Heorot within quickly with hands_.--The former has the advantage of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    affording a parallel to 'gefrætwod': both have the disadvantage of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    altering the text.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] The passage 1005-1009 seems to be hopeless. One difficult point is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    to find a subject for 'gesacan.' Some say 'he'; others supply 'each,'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _i.e., every soul-bearer ... must gain the inevitable place_. The
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    genitives in this case are partitive.--If 'he' be subj., the genitives
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    are dependent on 'gearwe' (= prepared).--The 'he' itself is disputed,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    some referring it to Grendel; but B. takes it as involved in the

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] The separation of adjective and noun by a phrase (cf. v. 1118)
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    being very unusual, some scholars have put 'earme on eaxle' with the

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    eaxe' (_i.e._, on the ashes, cinders) is sometimes read, and this
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    affords a parallel to 'on bæl.' Let us hope that a satisfactory

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] For 1130 (1) R. and Gr. suggest 'elne unflitme' as 1098 (1) reads.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The latter verse is undisputed; and, for the former, 'elne' would be
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    as possible as 'ealles,' and 'unflitme' is well supported. Accepting
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'elne unflitme' for both, I would suggest '_very peaceably_' for both

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (swíðe), needs no argument; and 'unflitme' (from 'flítan') can, it
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    seems to me, be more plausibly rendered 'peaceful,' 'peaceable,' than
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'contestable,' or 'conquerable.'

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] Some scholars have proposed 'roden'; the line would then read:

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] C. suggests a semicolon after 'city,' with 'he' as supplied

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] For 'feorh' S. suggests 'feoh': 'corpse' in the translation would
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    then be changed to '_possessions_,' '_belongings_.' This is a better

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] I believe this translation brings out the meaning of the poet,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    without departing seriously from the H.-So. text. 'Oft' frequently
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    means 'constantly,' 'continually,' not always 'often.'--Why 'an (on)

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    combat), I cannot see. 'Gearwe' occurs quite frequently with 'on'; cf.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    B. 1110 (_ready for the pyre_), El. 222 (_ready for the glad
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    journey_). Moreover, what has the idea of single combat to do with B.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    1247 ff.? The poet is giving an inventory of the arms and armor which

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    an adj. limiting 'sweord': H.-So. renders it as a subst. (So v. 1491.)
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The sense of the translation would be the same.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] B. suggests 'under hróf genam' (v. 1303). This emendation, as well
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    as an emendation with (?) to v. 739, he offers, because 'under'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    baffles him in both passages. All we need is to take 'under' in its
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    secondary meaning of 'in,' which, though not given by Grein, occurs in
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the literature. Cf. Chron. 876 (March's A.-S. Gram. § 355) and Oro.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Amaz. I. 10, where 'under' = _in the midst of_. Cf. modern Eng. 'in
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    such circumstances,' which interchanges in good usage with 'under such
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    circumstances.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] For 'néod-laðu' (1321) C. suggests 'néad-láðum,' and translates:
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _asked whether the night had been pleasant to him after
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    crushing-hostility_.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The brand was brilliant, brightly it glimmered,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Give Grendel requital for the many assaults he
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Had worked on the West-Danes not once, but often,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{Beowulf sees the body of Grendel, and cuts off his head.}

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] 'Þæs monige gewearð' (1599) and 'hafað þæs geworden' (2027).--In a
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    paper published some years ago in one of the Johns Hopkins University
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    circulars, I tried to throw upon these two long-doubtful passages some
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    light derived from a study of like passages in Alfred's prose.--The
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    impersonal verb 'geweorðan,' with an accus. of the person, and a
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    þæt-clause is used several times with the meaning 'agree.' See Orosius
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (Sweet's ed.) 178_7; 204_34; 208_28; 210_15; 280_20. In the two
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Beowulf passages, the þæt-clause is anticipated by 'þæs,' which is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    clearly a gen. of the thing agreed on.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The first passage (v. 1599 (b)-1600) I translate literally: _Then many
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    agreed upon this (namely), that the sea-wolf had killed him_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The second passage (v. 2025 (b)-2027): _She is promised ...; to this
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the friend of the Scyldings has agreed, etc_. By emending 'is' instead
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    of 'wæs' (2025), the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    In v. 1997 ff. this same idiom occurs, and was noticed in B.'s great
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    article on Beowulf, which appeared about the time I published my
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    reading of 1599 and 2027. Translate 1997 then: _Wouldst let the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    South-Danes themselves decide about their struggle with Grendel_. Here
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'Súð-Dene' is accus. of person, and 'gúðe' is gen. of thing agreed on.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    With such collateral support as that afforded by B. (P. and B. XII.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    97), I have no hesitation in departing from H.-So., my usual guide.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The idiom above treated runs through A.-S., Old Saxon, and other
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Teutonic languages, and should be noticed in the lexicons.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] 'Bróden-mæl' is regarded by most scholars as meaning a damaskeened
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    sword. Translate: _The damaskeened sword burned up_. Cf. 25_16 and

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    To render this, "_nobly bold_," "_excellently bold_," have been
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    suggested. B. would read 'cyning-holde' (cf. 290), and render: _Men

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The man was so dear that he failed to suppress the

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Along by the mast then a sea-garment fluttered,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Bade he up then take the treasure of princes,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          When the hand-strife was over, edges were ready,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          That fierce-raging sword-point had to force a decision,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          For a lady to practise, though lovely her person,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          That a weaver-of-peace, on pretence of anger
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          A belovèd liegeman of life should deprive.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Soothly this hindered Heming's kinsman;
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       55 Other ale-drinking earlmen asserted
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          That fearful folk-sorrows fewer she wrought them,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[67]      Enjoyed in her lifetime, love did she hold with
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The ruler of heroes, the best, it is told me,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       65 Of all of the earthmen that oceans encompass,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Of earl-kindreds endless; hence Offa was famous
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Far and widely, by gifts and by battles,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Spear-valiant hero; the home of his fathers
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          He governed with wisdom, whence Eomær did issue
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       70 For help unto heroes, Heming's kinsman,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Grandson of Garmund, great in encounters.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] For 'scawan' (1896), 'scaðan' has been proposed. Accepting this,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    we may render: _He said the bright-armored warriors were going to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    their vessel, welcome, etc_. (Cf. 1804.)
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] R. suggests, 'Gewát him on naca,' and renders: _The vessel set
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    out, to drive on the sea, the Dane-country left_. 'On' bears the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    alliteration; cf. 'on hafu' (2524). This has some advantages over the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    H.-So. reading; viz. (1) It adds nothing to the text; (2) it makes
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'naca' the subject, and thus brings the passage into keeping with the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    context, where the poet has exhausted his vocabulary in detailing the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    actions of the vessel.--B.'s emendation (cf. P. and B. XII. 97) is
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    violent.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] B. translates: _Who for a long time, ready at the coast, had
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    looked out into the distance eagerly for the dear men_. This changes
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the syntax of 'léofra manna.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] For 'wunað' (v. 1924) several eminent critics suggest 'wunade'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (=remained). This makes the passage much clearer.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] Why should such a woman be described as an 'excellent' queen? C.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    suggests 'frécnu' = dangerous, bold.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [6] For 'an dæges' various readings have been offered. If 'and-éges'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    be accepted, the sentence will read: _No hero ... dared look upon her,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    eye to eye_. If 'án-dæges' be adopted, translate: _Dared look upon her
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the whole day_.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] This is perhaps the least understood sentence in the poem, almost
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    every word being open to dispute. (1) The 'nó' of our text is an
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    emendation, and is rejected by many scholars. (2) 'Seldan' is by some
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    taken as an adv. (= _seldom_), and by others as a noun (= _page_,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _companion_). (3) 'Léod-hryre,' some render '_fall of the people_';
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    others, '_fall of the prince_.' (4) 'Búgeð,' most scholars regard as
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the intrans. verb meaning '_bend_,' '_rest_'; but one great scholar has
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    translated it '_shall kill_.' (5) 'Hwær,' Very recently, has been
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    attacked, 'wære' being suggested. (6) As a corollary to the above, the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    same critic proposes to drop 'oft' out of the text.--t.B. suggests: Oft
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    seldan wære after léodhryre: lýtle hwíle bongár búgeð, þéah séo brýd

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] For 'eafor' (2153), Kl. suggests 'ealdor.' Translate then: _Bade
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the prince then to bear in the banner, battle-high helmet, etc_. On
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the other hand, W. takes 'eaforhéafodsegn' as a compound, meaning
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'helmet': _He bade them bear in the helmet, battle-high helm, gray

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] The H.-So. rendering (ærest = _history, origin_; 'eft' for 'est'),
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    though liable to objection, is perhaps the best offered. 'That I
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    should very early tell thee of his favor, kindness' sounds well; but
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'his' is badly placed to limit 'ést.'--Perhaps, 'eft' with verbs of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    saying may have the force of Lat. prefix 're,' and the H.-So. reading
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    mean, 'that I should its origin rehearse to thee.'

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Encompassed with fire; men under heaven

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          So three-hundred winters the waster of peoples
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Held upon earth that excellent hoard-hall,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Till the forementioned earlman angered him bitterly:
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       60 The beat-plated beaker he bare to his chieftain
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          And fullest remission for all his remissness
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Begged of his liegelord. Then the hoard[5] was discovered,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The treasure was taken, his petition was granted
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{The hero plunders the dragon's den}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The lorn-mooded liegeman. His lord regarded
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       65 The old-work of earth-folk--'twas the earliest occasion.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          When the dragon awoke, the strife was renewed there;
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          He snuffed 'long the stone then, stout-hearted found he
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[78]      The footprint of foeman; too far had he gone
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          With cunning craftiness close to the head of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       70 The fire-spewing dragon. So undoomed he may 'scape from
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Anguish and exile with ease who possesseth
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The favor of Heaven. The hoard-warden eagerly
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Searched o'er the ground then, would meet with the person
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          That caused him sorrow while in slumber reclining:
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       75 Gleaming and wild he oft went round the cavern,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          All of it outward; not any of earthmen
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Was seen in that desert.[6] Yet he joyed in the battle,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Rejoiced in the conflict: oft he turned to the barrow,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Sought for the gem-cup;[7] this he soon perceived then
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{The dragon perceives that some one has disturbed his treasure.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       80 That some man or other had discovered the gold,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The famous folk-treasure. Not fain did the hoard-ward
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Wait until evening; then the ward of the barrow
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Was angry in spirit, the loathèd one wished to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Pay for the dear-valued drink-cup with fire.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       85 Then the day was done as the dragon would have it,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          He no longer would wait on the wall, but departed
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{The dragon is infuriated.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Fire-impelled, flaming. Fearful the start was
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          To earls in the land, as it early thereafter
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          To their giver-of-gold was grievously ended.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] For 'long-gestréona,' B. suggests 'láengestréona,' and renders,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _Of fleeting treasures_. S. accepts H.'s 'long-gestréona,' but
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    renders, _The treasure long in accumulating_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] For 'hard-fyrdne' (2246), B. first suggested 'hard-fyndne,'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    rendering: _A heap of treasures ... so great that its equal would be
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    hard to find_. The same scholar suggests later 'hord-wynne dæl' = _A
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    deal of treasure-joy_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] Some read 'fec-word' (2247), and render: _Banning words uttered_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] An earlier reading of H.'s gave the following meaning to this
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    passage: _He is said to inhabit a mound under the earth, where he,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    etc._ The translation in the text is more authentic.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] The repetition of 'hord' in this passage has led some scholars to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    suggest new readings to avoid the second 'hord.' This, however, is not
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    under the main stress, and, it seems to me, might easily be accepted.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [6] The reading of H.-So. is well defended in the notes to that
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    volume. B. emends and renders: _Nor was there any man in that desert
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    who rejoiced in conflict, in battle-work._ That is, the hoard-ward
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    could not find any one who had disturbed his slumbers, for no warrior
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    was there, t.B.'s emendation would give substantially the same
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    translation.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [7] 'Sinc-fæt' (2301): this word both here and in v. 2232, t.B.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Hrethel; but the translator here departs from his editor by
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    understanding the poet to refer to a hypothetical old man, introduced
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    as an illustration of a father's sorrow.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Hrethrel had certainly never seen a son of his ride on the gallows to

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The passage beginning 'swá bið géomorlic' seems to be an effort to
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    reach a full simile, 'as ... so.' 'As it is mournful for an old man,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    The verses 2451 to 2463-1/2 would be parenthetical, the poet's feelings
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    being so strong as to interrupt the simile. The punctuation of the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    fourth edition would be better--a comma after 'galgan' (2447). The
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    translation may be indicated as follows: _(Just) as it is sad for an

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The lord of the Geatmen uplifted his hand then,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] The clause 2520(2)-2522(1), rendered by 'Wist I ... monster,' Gr.,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    followed by S., translates substantially as follows: _If I knew how
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    else I might combat the boastful defiance of the monster_.--The
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    translation turns upon 'wiðgrípan,' a word not understood.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] B. emends and translates: _I will not flee the space of a foot
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    from the guard of the barrow, but there shall be to us a fight at the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    wall, as fate decrees, each one's Creator._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] The translation of this passage is based on 'unsláw' (2565),
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    accepted by H.-So., in lieu of the long-standing 'ungléaw.' The former
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    is taken as an adj. limiting 'sweord'; the latter as an adj. c.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'gúð-cyning': _The good war-king, rash with edges, brandished his
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    sword, his old relic._ The latter gives a more rhetorical Anglo-Saxon
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (poetical) sentence.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          To behold the hoard 'neath the hoar-grayish stone,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       50 Well-lovèd Wiglaf, now the worm is a-lying,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Sore-wounded sleepeth, disseized of his treasure.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Go thou in haste that treasures of old I,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Gold-wealth may gaze on, together see lying
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[93]      The ether-bright jewels, be easier able,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       55 Having the heap of hoard-gems, to yield my
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Life and the land-folk whom long I have governed."
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] B. renders: _He_ (_W_.) did not regard his (_the dragon's_) _head_
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (since Beowulf had struck it without effect), _but struck the dragon a
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    little lower down.--_One crux is to find out _whose head_ is meant;
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    another is to bring out the antithesis between 'head' and 'hand.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] 'Þæt þæt fýr' (2702), S. emends to 'þá þæt fýr' = _when the fire
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    began to grow less intense afterward_. This emendation relieves the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    passage of a plethora of conjunctive _þæt_'s.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] For 'gefyldan' (2707), S. proposes 'gefylde.' The passage would
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    read: _He felled the foe (life drove out strength), and they then both
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    had destroyed him, chieftains related_. This gives Beowulf the credit
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    of having felled the dragon; then they combine to annihilate him.--For
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'ellen' (2707), Kl. suggests 'e(a)llne.'--The reading '_life drove out
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    strength_' is very unsatisfactory and very peculiar. I would suggest
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    as follows: Adopt S.'s emendation, remove H.'s parenthesis, read
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'ferh-ellen wræc,' and translate: _He felled the foe, drove out his
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    life-strength_ (that is, made him _hors de combat_), _and then they
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    both, etc_.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Robbed of their ornaments: there were helmets in numbers,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Old and rust-eaten, arm-bracelets many,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Artfully woven. Wealth can easily,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          And he saw there lying an all-golden banner
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          High o'er the hoard, of hand-wonders greatest,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Linkèd with lacets: a light from it sparkled,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Bare on his bosom the beakers and platters,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       25 As himself would fain have it, and took off the standard,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Curiosity urged him if, excellent-mooded,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Alive he should find the lord of the Weders

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{The hero's last gift}

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The bold-mooded troop-lord took from his neck then
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The ring that was golden, gave to his liegeman,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The youthful war-hero, his gold-flashing helmet,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          His collar and war-mail, bade him well to enjoy them:
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{and last words.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       60 "Thou art latest left of the line of our kindred,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Of Wægmunding people: Weird hath offcarried

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] The word 'oferhígian' (2767) being vague and little understood,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    two quite distinct translations of this passage have arisen. One takes
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'oferhígian' as meaning 'to exceed,' and, inserting 'hord' after
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'gehwone,' renders: _The treasure may easily, the gold in the ground,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    exceed in value every hoard of man, hide it who will._ The other takes
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'oferhígian' as meaning 'to render arrogant,' and, giving the sentence
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    a moralizing tone, renders substantially as in the body of this work.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    (Cf. 28_13 et seq.)
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] The passage beginning here is very much disputed. 'The bill of the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    old lord' is by some regarded as Beowulf's sword; by others, as that
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    of the ancient possessor of the hoard. 'Ær gescód' (2778), translated
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    in this work as verb and adverb, is by some regarded as a compound
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    participial adj. = _sheathed in brass_.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Was scorched in the fire; as he lay there he measured
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Fifty of feet; came forth in the night-time[5]
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t      100 To rejoice in the air, thereafter departing
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          To visit his den; he in death was then fastened,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          He would joy in no other earth-hollowed caverns.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          There stood round about him beakers and vessels,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Dishes were lying and dear-valued weapons,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t      105 With iron-rust eaten, as in earth's mighty bosom
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          A thousand of winters there they had rested:

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{The hoard was under a magic spell.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          That mighty bequest then with magic was guarded,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Gold of the ancients, that earlman not any
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The ring-hall could touch, save Ruling-God only,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          E'en to such among mortals as seemed to Him proper.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] For 'góda,' which seems a surprising epithet for a Geat to apply
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    to the "terrible" Ongentheow, B. suggests 'gomela.' The passage would
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    then stand: '_The old one went then,' etc._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] For 'segn Higeláce,' K., Th., and B. propose 'segn Higeláces,'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    meaning: _Higelac's banner followed the Swedes (in pursuit)._--S.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    suggests 'sæcc Higeláces,' and renders: _Higelac's pursuit._--The
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    H.-So. reading, as translated in our text, means that the banner of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the enemy was captured and brought to Higelac as a trophy.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] The rendering given in this translation represents the king as
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    being generous beyond the possibility of reproach; but some
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    authorities construe 'him' (2996) as plu., and understand the passage
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    more reward than they were entitled to.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] The name 'Scyldingas' here (3006) has caused much discussion, and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    given rise to several theories, the most important of which are as
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    follows: (1) After the downfall of Hrothgar's family, Beowulf was king
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    of the Danes, or Scyldings. (2) For 'Scyldingas' read
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'Scylfingas'--that is, after killing Eadgils, the Scylfing prince,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    Beowulf conquered his land, and held it in subjection. (3) M.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    considers 3006 a thoughtless repetition of 2053. (Cf. H.-So.)
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] B. takes 'nihtes' and 'hwílum' (3045) as separate adverbial cases,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    and renders: _Joy in the air had he of yore by night, etc_. He thinks
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [6] The parenthesis is by some emended so as to read: (1) (_He_ (i.e.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _God_) _is the hope of men_); (2) (_he is the hope of heroes_). Gr.'s
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    reading has no parenthesis, but says: ... _could touch, unless God
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    himself, true king of victories, gave to whom he would to open the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    treasure, the secret place of enchanters, etc_. The last is rejected
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    on many grounds.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The prince of the people pricked to come thither.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       30 _I_ was therein and all of it looked at,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          And held in my hands a huge-weighing burden
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       35 Of hoard-treasures costly, hither out bare them
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          To my liegelord belovèd: life was yet in him,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          And consciousness also; the old one discoursed then
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Much and mournfully, commanded to greet you,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Bade that remembering the deeds of your friend-lord
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       40 Ye build on the fire-hill of corpses a lofty
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Burial-barrow, broad and far-famous,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          As 'mid world-dwelling warriors he was widely most honored
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          While he reveled in riches. Let us rouse us and hasten
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[105]     Again to see and seek for the treasure,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{Wiglaf charges them to build a funeral-pyre.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Then the son of Wihstan bade orders be given,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Mood-valiant man, to many of heroes,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Holders of homesteads, that they hither from far,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          [6]Leaders of liegemen, should look for the good one
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       55 With wood for his pyre: "The flame shall now swallow
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          (The wan fire shall wax[7]) the warriors' leader
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Who the rain of the iron often abided,

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Leapt o'er linden-wall, the lance rendered service,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       60 Furnished with feathers followed the arrow."
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Now the wise-mooded son of Wihstan did summon
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The best of the braves from the band of the ruler
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{He takes seven thanes, and enters the den.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Seven together; 'neath the enemy's roof he
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Went with the seven; one of the heroes
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       65 Who fared at the front, a fire-blazing torch-light
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Bare in his hand. No lot then decided
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Who that hoard should havoc, when hero-earls saw it
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Lying in the cavern uncared-for entirely,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          Rusting to ruin: they rued then but little
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       70 That they hastily hence hauled out the treasure,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{They push the dragon over the wall.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The dear-valued jewels; the dragon eke pushed they,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The worm o'er the wall, let the wave-currents take him,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[106]     The waters enwind the ward of the treasures.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t{The hoard is laid on a wain.}
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          There wounden gold on a wain was uploaded,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t       75 A mass unmeasured, the men-leader off then,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t          The hero hoary, to Whale's-Ness was carried.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [1] For 'gehýdde,' B. suggests 'gehýðde': the passage would stand as
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    above except the change of 'hidden' (v. 2) to 'plundered.' The
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    reference, however, would be to the thief, not to the dragon.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [2] The passage 'Wundur ... búan' (3063-3066), M. took to be a
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    question asking whether it was strange that a man should die when his
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    appointed time had come.--B. sees a corruption, and makes emendations
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    introducing the idea that a brave man should not die from sickness or
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    from old age, but should find death in the performance of some deed of
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    daring.--S. sees an indirect question introduced by 'hwár' and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    dependent upon 'wundur': _A secret is it when the hero is to die,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    etc_.--Why may the two clauses not be parallel, and the whole passage
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    an Old English cry of '_How wonderful is death!'?_--S.'s is the best
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    yet offered, if 'wundor' means 'mystery.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [3] For 'strude' in H.-So., S. suggests 'stride.' This would require
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    'ravage' (v. 16) to be changed to 'tread.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [4] 'He cared ... sight of' (17, 18), S. emends so as to read as
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    follows: _He (Beowulf) had not before seen the favor of the avaricious
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    possessor._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [5] B. renders: _That which drew the king thither_ (i.e. _the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    treasure_) _was granted us, but in such a way that it overcomes us._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [6] 'Folc-ágende' (3114) B. takes as dat. sing. with 'gódum,' and
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    refers it to Beowulf; that is, _Should bring fire-wood to the place
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    where the good folk-ruler lay_.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    [7] C. proposes to take 'weaxan' = L. 'vescor,' and translate
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    _devour_. This gives a parallel to 'fretan' above. The parenthesis
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    would be discarded and the passage read: _Now shall the fire consume,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t    the wan-flame devour, the prince of warriors, etc_.

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tADDENDA.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tSeveral discrepancies and other oversights have been noticed in the H.-So.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tglossary. Of these a good part were avoided by Harrison and Sharp, the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tAmerican editors of Beowulf, in their last edition, 1888. The rest will, I
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\thope, be noticed in their fourth edition. As, however, this book may fall
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tinto the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tbest to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~From hám~ (194).--Notes and glossary conflict; the latter not having been
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\taltered to suit the conclusions accepted in the former.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Þær gelýfan sceal dryhtnes dóme~ (440).--Under 'dóm' H. says 'the might
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tof the Lord'; while under 'gelýfan' he says 'the judgment of the Lord.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Eal bencþelu~ (486).--Under 'benc-þelu' H. says _nom. plu._; while under
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t'eal' he says _nom. sing._
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Heatho-ræmas~ (519).--Under 'ætberan' H. translates 'to the Heathoremes';
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twhile under 'Heatho-ræmas' he says 'Heathoræmas reaches Breca in the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tswimming-match with Beowulf.' Harrison and Sharp (3d edition, 1888) avoid
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthe discrepancy.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Fáh féond-scaða~ (554).--Under 'féond-scaða' H. says 'a gleaming
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tsea-monster'; under 'fáh' he says 'hostile.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Onfeng hraðe inwit-þancum~ (749).--Under 'onfón' H. says 'he _received_

BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Níð-wundor séon~ (1366).--Under 'níð-wundor' H. calls this word itself
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t_nom. sing._; under 'séon' he translates it as accus. sing., understanding
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t'man' as subject of 'séon.' H. and S. (3d edition) make the correction.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Forgeaf hilde-bille~ (1521).--H., under the second word, calls it instr.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tdat.; while under 'forgifan' he makes it the dat. of indir. obj. H. and S.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t(3d edition) make the change.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Brád~ and ~brún-ecg~ (1547).--Under 'brád' H. says 'das breite Hüftmesser
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmit bronzener Klinge'; under 'brún-ecg' he says 'ihr breites Hüftmesser
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tmit blitzender Klinge.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t[110]
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Yðelíce~ (1557).--Under this word H. makes it modify 'ástód.' If this be
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tright, the punctuation of the fifth edition is wrong. See H. and S.,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tappendix.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Sélran gesóhte~ (1840).--Under 'sél' and 'gesécan' H. calls these two
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\twords accus. plu.; but this is clearly an error, as both are nom. plu.,
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tpred. nom. H. and S. correct under 'sél.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Wið sylfne~ (1978).--Under 'wið' and 'gesittan' H. says 'wið = near, by';
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tunder 'self' he says 'opposite.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~þéow~ (2225) is omitted from the glossary.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~For duguðum~ (2502).--Under 'duguð' H. translates this phrase, 'in
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tTüchtigkeit'; under 'for,' by 'vor der edlen Kriegerschaar.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~þær~ (2574).--Under 'wealdan' H. translates _þær_ by 'wo'; under 'mótan,'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tby 'da.' H. and S. suggest 'if' in both passages.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Wunde~ (2726).--Under 'wund' H. says 'dative,' and under 'wæl-bléate' he
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tsays 'accus.' It is without doubt accus., parallel with 'benne.'
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Strengum gebæded~ (3118).--Under 'strengo' H. says 'Strengum' = mit
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tMacht; under 'gebæded' he translates 'von den Sehnen.' H. and S. correct
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tthis discrepancy by rejecting the second reading.
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t~Bronda be láfe~ (3162).--A recent emendation. The fourth edition had
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\t'bronda betost.' In the fifth edition the editor neglects to change the
BeowulfbyJLesslieHall.txt\tglossary to suit the new emendation. See 'bewyrcan.'
