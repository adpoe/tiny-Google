   560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by

   580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER I.
   581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYOU don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
   583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAdventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter.  That book was made
   584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things
   585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhich he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I
   586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt
   587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPolly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom’s Aunt Polly, she
   588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which
   589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.
   590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   591	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNow the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money
   592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six
   593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when
   594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out
   595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
   596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tround--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas
   597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was
   598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
   599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand
   600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
   601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and
   602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I
   603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.

   605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
   606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by
   607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but
   608	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing
   609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcommenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come
   610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but
   611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little
   612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the matter with
   613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a
   614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbarrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the
   615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjuice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.
   616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
   618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and
   619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so
   620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock in
   621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead people.
   622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she
   624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must
   625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttry to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They
   626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it.  Here she was
   627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,
   628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeing gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a
   629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that
   630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all right, because she done it herself.
   631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHer sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,
   633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a
   634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then
   635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe widow made her ease up.  I couldn’t stood it much longer.  Then for
   636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tan hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,
   637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up
   638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would
   639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay, “Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don’t you try to
   640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehave?”  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished
   641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm.  All I wanted
   642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular.
   643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for
   644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.
   645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I
   646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade up my mind I wouldn’t try for it.  But I never said so, because it
   647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good.
   648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
   650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
   651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn’t think
   652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer
   653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad
   654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout that, because I wanted him and me to be together.
   655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
   657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
   658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,
   659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and
   660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use.  I felt
   661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the
   662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away
   663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a
   664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying
   665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so
   666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard
   667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about
   668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so
   669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night
   670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some
   671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcompany.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I
   672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it
   673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all shriveled up.  I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was
   674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared
   675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my
   676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied
   677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But
   678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hadn’t no confidence.  You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that
   679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever
   680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed
   681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta spider.
   682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;
   684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t
   685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town
   686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than
   687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
   688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I
   689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there.  That was good!
   690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the
   691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped
   692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,
   693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.
   694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER II.
   699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
   701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our
   702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made
   703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson’s big nigger,
   704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnamed Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty
   705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched
   706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:
   707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who dah?”
   709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
   711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetween us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was
   712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close
   713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I
   714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
   715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright between my shoulders.  Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch.
   716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with
   717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t
   718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsleepy--if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why
   719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim
   720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
   721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n.
   723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I know what I’s gwyne to do:  I’s gwyne to set down here and
   724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlisten tell I hears it agin.”
   725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up
   727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched
   728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into
   729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy eyes.  But I dasn’t scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.
   730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext I got to itching underneath.  I didn’t know how I was going to set
   731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but
   732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different
   733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplaces now.  I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer,
   734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun
   735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon
   736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable again.
   737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we
   739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom
   740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said
   741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I
   742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would slip
   743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the kitchen and get some more.  I didn’t want him to try.  I said Jim
   744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmight wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there
   745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.
   746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do
   747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play
   748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was
   749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso still and lonesome.
   750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
   752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
   753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe house.  Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it
   754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake.
   755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,
   756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,
   757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told
   758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every
   759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
   760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back
   761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he
   762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come
   763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
   764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths
   765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\topen and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is
   766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but
   767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,
   768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim would happen in and say, “Hm!  What you know ‘bout witches?” and
   769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept
   770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a
   771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcharm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could
   772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by
   773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.
   774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they
   775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn’t touch
   776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for
   777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil
   778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand been rode by witches.
   779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
   781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where
   782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever
   783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and
   784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and
   785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBen Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.
   786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,
   787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.
   788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
   790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
   791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpart of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
   792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
   793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\topened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
   794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole.  We
   795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and
   796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:
   797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang.
   799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name
   800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin blood.”
   801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
   803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the
   804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tband, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
   805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tany boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and
   806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he
   807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign
   808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that
   809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be
   810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkilled.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he
   811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmust have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the
   812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with
   813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it
   814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand be forgot forever.
   815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got
   817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
   818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had

   820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSome thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told
   822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote
   823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit in. Then Ben Rogers says:
   824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ‘bout
   826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim?”
   827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.
   829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   830	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days.  He
   831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seen
   832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin these parts for a year or more.”
   833	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   834	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they
   835	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it
   836	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of
   837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready
   838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss
   839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWatson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:
   840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, she’ll do.  That’s all right.  Huck can come in.”
   842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,
   844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I made my mark on the paper.
   845	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”
   847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   848	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.
   849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--”
   851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,”
   853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t says Tom Sawyer.  “We ain’t burglars.  That ain’t no sort of style.  We
   854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tare highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks
   855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”
   856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Must we always kill the people?”
   858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, certainly.  It’s best.  Some authorities think different, but
   860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmostly it’s considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to
   861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”
   862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ransomed?  What’s that?”
   864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   865	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know.  But that’s what they do.  I’ve seen it in books; and so
   866	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof course that’s what we’ve got to do.”
   867	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   868	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”
   869	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   870	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, blame it all, we’ve _got_ to do it.  Don’t I tell you it’s in the
   871	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbooks?  Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books,
   872	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand get things all muddled up?”
   873	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   874	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that’s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation
   875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tare these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it
   876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto them?--that’s the thing I want to get at.  Now, what do you reckon it
   877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis?”
   878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t know.  But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed,
   880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit means that we keep them till they’re dead.”
   881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, that’s something _like_.  That’ll answer.  Why couldn’t you said
   883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat before?  We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a
   884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbothersome lot they’ll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying
   885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto get loose.”
   886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How you talk, Ben Rogers.  How can they get loose when there’s a guard
   888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”
   889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A guard!  Well, that _is_ good.  So somebody’s got to set up all night
   891	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.  I think that’s
   892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as
   893	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey get here?”
   894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because it ain’t in the books so--that’s why.  Now, Ben Rogers, do you
   896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to do things regular, or don’t you?--that’s the idea.  Don’t you
   897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct
   898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing to do?  Do you reckon _you_ can learn ‘em anything?  Not by a good
   899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeal. No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”
   900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right.  I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow.  Say, do
   902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe kill the women, too?”
   903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on.  Kill
   905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe women?  No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.  You
   906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them;
   907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any
   908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore.”
   909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it.
   911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows
   912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers.
   913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”
   914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLittle Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was
   916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’t
   917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to be a robber any more.
   918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him
   920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.  But
   921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
   922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.
   923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBen Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted
   925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it
   926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton Sunday, and that settled the thing.  They agreed to get together and
   927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first
   928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaptain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.
   929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
   931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was
   932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdog-tired.
   933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

   936	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER III.
   938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on
   940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccount of my clothes; but the widow she didn’t scold, but only cleaned
   941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would
   942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehave awhile if I could.  Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet
   943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand prayed, but nothing come of it.  She told me to pray every day, and
   944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhatever I asked for I would get it.  But it warn’t so.  I tried it.
   945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOnce I got a fish-line, but no hooks.  It warn’t any good to me without
   946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thooks.  I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I
   947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make it work.  By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to
   948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttry for me, but she said I was a fool.  She never told me why, and I
   949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make it out no way.
   950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.
   952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don’t
   953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDeacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?  Why can’t the widow get
   954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback her silver snuffbox that was stole?  Why can’t Miss Watson fat up?
   955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNo, says I to my self, there ain’t nothing in it.  I went and told the
   956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for
   957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was “spiritual gifts.”  This was too many for me, but she told me
   958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for
   959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about
   960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.  I went out in the
   961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see no
   962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tadvantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned
   963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go.  Sometimes the
   964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make
   965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta body’s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold
   966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand knock it all down again.  I judged I could see that there was two
   967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tProvidences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
   968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow’s Providence, but if Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no help
   969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor him any more.  I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong
   970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the widow’s if he wanted me, though I couldn’t make out how he was
   971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was
   972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.
   973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPap he hadn’t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable
   975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me; I didn’t want to see him no more.  He used to always whale me
   976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take
   977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the woods most of the time when he was around.  Well, about this time
   978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
   979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople said.  They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was
   980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all
   981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike pap; but they couldn’t make nothing out of the face, because it had
   982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen in the water so long it warn’t much like a face at all.  They said
   983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was floating on his back in the water.  They took him and buried him
   984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the bank.  But I warn’t comfortable long, because I happened to think
   985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof something.  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don’t float on
   986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this back, but on his face.  So I knowed, then, that this warn’t pap, but
   987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta woman dressed up in a man’s clothes.  So I was uncomfortable again.
   988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he
   989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t.
   990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
   991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.  All
   992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe boys did.  We hadn’t robbed nobody, hadn’t killed any people, but
   993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly just pretended.  We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
   994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,
   995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut we never hived any of them.  Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,”
   996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,” and we would go to the
   997	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed
   998	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand marked.  But I couldn’t see no profit in it.  One time Tom sent a
   999	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan
  1000	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t(which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he
  1001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
  1002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmerchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
  1003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand “sumter”
  1004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t mules, all loaded down with di’monds, and they didn’t have only a guard
  1005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called
  1006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, and kill the lot and scoop the things.  He said we must slick up
  1007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tour swords and guns, and get ready.  He never could go after even a
  1008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,
  1009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthough they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them
  1010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill you rotted, and then they warn’t worth a mouthful of ashes more
  1011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan what they was before.  I didn’t believe we could lick such a crowd
  1012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,
  1013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got
  1014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.  But there warn’t
  1015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn’t no camels nor no elephants.
  1016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class
  1017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat that.  We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we
  1018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got
  1019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the
  1020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tteacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.
  1021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I didn’t see no di’monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.  He said there was
  1023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,
  1024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand elephants and things.  I said, why couldn’t we see them, then?  He
  1025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid if I warn’t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I
  1026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould know without asking.  He said it was all done by enchantment.  He
  1027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,
  1028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had
  1029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.
  1030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the
  1031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmagicians.  Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.
  1032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why,” said he, “a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they
  1034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson.  They
  1035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tare as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.”
  1036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “s’pose we got some genies to help _us_--can’t we lick
  1038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe other crowd then?”
  1039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How you going to get them?”
  1041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know.  How do _they_ get them?”

  1044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies

  1047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t They don’t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and
  1048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any

  1051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who makes them tear around so?”
  1052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.  They belong to whoever rubs
  1054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe lamp or the ring, and they’ve got to do whatever he says.  If he
  1055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds, and fill
  1056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor’s
  1057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdaughter from China for you to marry, they’ve got to do it--and they’ve
  1058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to do it before sun-up next morning, too.  And more:  they’ve got
  1059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you

  1061	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1062	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says I, “I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping
  1063	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe palace themselves ‘stead of fooling them away like that.  And what’s
  1064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would
  1065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.”
  1066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How you talk, Huck Finn.  Why, you’d _have_ to come when he rubbed it,

  1069	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church?  All right, then;
  1071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI _would_ come; but I lay I’d make that man climb the highest tree there

  1073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks, it ain’t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.  You don’t seem to

  1076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I
  1078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould see if there was anything in it.  I got an old tin lamp and an
  1079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tiron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat
  1080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn’t
  1081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno use, none of the genies come.  So then I judged that all that stuff
  1082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas only just one of Tom Sawyer’s lies.  I reckoned he believed in the
  1083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tA-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different.  It had all

  1089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER IV.
  1090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1091	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter
  1092	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and
  1093	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrite just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six
  1094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes seven is thirty-five, and I don’t reckon I could ever get any
  1095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther than that if I was to live forever.  I don’t take no stock in
  1096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmathematics, anyway.
  1097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAt first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.
  1099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
  1100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday done me good and cheered me up.  So the longer I went to school the
  1101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teasier it got to be.  I was getting sort of used to the widow’s ways,
  1102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo, and they warn’t so raspy on me.  Living in a house and sleeping in
  1103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I
  1104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a
  1105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trest to me.  I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the
  1106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnew ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but
  1107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsure, and doing very satisfactory.  She said she warn’t ashamed of me.
  1108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.
  1110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left
  1111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,
  1112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand crossed me off. She says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what
  1113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta mess you are always making!”  The widow put in a good word for me, but
  1114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat warn’t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.
  1115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and
  1116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.
  1117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn’t one
  1118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along
  1119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlow-spirited and on the watch-out.
  1120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
  1122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the high board fence.  There was an inch of new snow on the
  1123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tground, and I seen somebody’s tracks.  They had come up from the quarry
  1124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden
  1125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfence.  It was funny they hadn’t come in, after standing around so.  I
  1126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make it out.  It was very curious, somehow.  I was going to
  1127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.  I didn’t
  1128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice anything at first, but next I did.  There was a cross in the left
  1129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.
  1130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was up in a second and shinning down the hill.  I looked over my
  1132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoulder every now and then, but I didn’t see nobody.  I was at Judge
  1133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher’s as quick as I could get there.  He said:
  1134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.  Did you come for your
  1136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest?”
  1137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir,” I says; “is there some for me?”
  1139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty
  1141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars.  Quite a fortune for you.  You had better let me invest it
  1142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong with your six thousand, because if you take it you’ll spend it.”
  1143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir,” I says, “I don’t want to spend it.  I don’t want it at
  1145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall--nor the six thousand, nuther.  I want you to take it; I want to give
  1146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit to you--the six thousand and all.”
  1147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked surprised.  He couldn’t seem to make it out.  He says:
  1149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, what can you mean, my boy?”
  1151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says, “Don’t you ask me no questions about it, please.  You’ll take
  1153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--won’t you?”
  1154	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe says:
  1156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’m puzzled.  Is something the matter?”
  1158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Please take it,” says I, “and don’t ask me nothing--then I won’t have to
  1160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell no lies.”
  1161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe studied a while, and then he says:
  1163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oho-o!  I think I see.  You want to _sell_ all your property to me--not
  1165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive it.  That’s the correct idea.”
  1166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1167	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:
  1168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1169	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’  That means I have bought
  1170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit of you and paid you for it.  Here’s a dollar for you.  Now you sign
  1171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
  1172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I signed it, and left.
  1174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Watson’s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which
  1176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
  1177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmagic with it.  He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed
  1178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything.  So I went to him that night and told him pap was here
  1179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, for I found his tracks in the snow.  What I wanted to know was,
  1180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat he was going to do, and was he going to stay?  Jim got out his
  1181	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped
  1182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit on the floor.  It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.
  1183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.
  1184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.
  1185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But it warn’t no use; he said it wouldn’t talk. He said sometimes it
  1186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t talk without money.  I told him I had an old slick counterfeit
  1187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquarter that warn’t no good because the brass showed through the silver
  1188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little, and it wouldn’t pass nohow, even if the brass didn’t show,
  1189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it
  1190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery time.  (I reckoned I wouldn’t say nothing about the dollar I got
  1191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball
  1192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould take it, because maybe it wouldn’t know the difference.  Jim smelt
  1193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball
  1194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato
  1195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next
  1196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmorning you couldn’t see no brass, and it wouldn’t feel greasy no more,
  1197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.
  1198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.
  1199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened
  1201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain. This time he said the hair-ball was all right.  He said it
  1202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.  I says, go on.  So the
  1203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me.  He says:
  1204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yo’ ole father doan’ know yit what he’s a-gwyne to do.  Sometimes he

  1227	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1228	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had shut the door to.  Then I turned around and there he was.  I used
  1229	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.  I reckoned I
  1230	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after
  1231	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being
  1232	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso unexpected; but right away after I see I warn’t scared of him worth
  1233	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbothring about.
  1234	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1235	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was most fifty, and he looked it.  His hair was long and tangled and
  1236	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgreasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through
  1237	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike he was behind vines.  It was all black, no gray; so was his long,
  1238	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmixed-up whiskers.  There warn’t no color in his face, where his face
  1239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed; it was white; not like another man’s white, but a white to make
  1240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta body sick, a white to make a body’s flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a
  1241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfish-belly white.  As for his clothes--just rags, that was all.  He had
  1242	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone ankle resting on t’other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and
  1243	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then.  His hat
  1244	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like
  1245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta lid.
  1246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair
  1248	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttilted back a little.  I set the candle down.  I noticed the window was
  1249	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup; so he had clumb in by the shed.  He kept a-looking me all over.  By
  1250	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by he says:
  1251	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1252	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Starchy clothes--very.  You think you’re a good deal of a big-bug,

  1254	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe I am, maybe I ain’t,” I says.
  1256	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  1271	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ll learn her how to meddle.  And looky here--you drop that
  1272	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tschool, you hear?  I’ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs
  1273	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover his own father and let on to be better’n what _he_ is.  You lemme
  1274	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcatch you fooling around that school again, you hear?  Your mother
  1275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t read, and she couldn’t write, nuther, before she died.  None
  1276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the family couldn’t before _they_ died.  I can’t; and here you’re

  1279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1280	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
  1281	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twars. When I’d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack
  1282	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith his hand and knocked it across the house.  He says:
  1283	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1284	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s so.  You can do it.  I had my doubts when you told me.  Now looky
  1285	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there; you stop that putting on frills.  I won’t have it.  I’ll lay for
  1286	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I’ll tan you good.
  1287	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFirst you know you’ll get religion, too.  I never see such a son.”
  1288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and
  1290	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  1291	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1292	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s this?”
  1293	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s something they give me for learning my lessons good.”
  1295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe tore it up, and says:
  1297	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll give you something better--I’ll give you a cowhide.”
  1299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:
  1301	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1302	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Ain’t_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though?  A bed; and bedclothes; and

  1331	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1332	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was
  1333	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing down town to get some whisky; said he hadn’t had a drink all day.
  1334	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed
  1335	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I
  1336	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me
  1337	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick
  1338	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme if I didn’t drop that.
  1339	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1340	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher’s and bullyragged
  1341	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn’t, and then
  1342	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the swore he’d make the law force him.
  1343	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1344	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away
  1345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that
  1346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad just come, and he didn’t know the old man; so he said courts mustn’t
  1347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinterfere and separate families if they could help it; said he’d druther
  1348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot take a child away from its father.  So Judge Thatcher and the widow
  1349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad to quit on the business.
  1350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat pleased the old man till he couldn’t rest.  He said he’d cowhide
  1352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme till I was black and blue if I didn’t raise some money for him.  I
  1353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tborrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got
  1354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
  1355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;
  1356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed
  1357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim again for a week.  But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss
  1358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof his son, and he’d make it warm for _him_.
  1359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.
  1361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and
  1362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just
  1363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told pie to him, so to speak.  And after supper he talked to him about
  1364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttemperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he’d been
  1365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over
  1366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn’t be ashamed of, and he hoped the
  1367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudge would help him and not look down on him.  The judge said he could
  1368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap
  1369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he’d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the
  1370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudge said he believed it.  The old man said that what a man wanted
  1371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried
  1372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain.  And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his
  1373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand, and says:
  1374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.
  1376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere’s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no more; it’s
  1377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hand of a man that’s started in on a new life, and’ll die before
  1378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’ll go back.  You mark them words--don’t forget I said them.  It’s a
  1379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclean hand now; shake it--don’t be afeard.”
  1380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.  The
  1382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudge’s wife she kissed it.  Then the old man he signed a pledge--made
  1383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something
  1384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was
  1385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
  1386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
  1387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnew coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old
  1388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and
  1389	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most
  1390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfroze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.  And when they come
  1391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could
  1392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnavigate it.
  1393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe judge he felt kind of sore.  He said he reckoned a body could reform
  1395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn’t know no other way.
  1396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER VI.
  1401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
  1403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
  1404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent for me, too, for not stopping school.  He catched me a couple of
  1405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged
  1406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim or outrun him most of the time.  I didn’t want to go to school much
  1407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore, but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap.  That law trial was a
  1408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslow business--appeared like they warn’t ever going to get started on it;
  1409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso every now and then I’d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge
  1410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.  Every time he got money he
  1411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and
  1412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery time he raised Cain he got jailed.  He was just suited--this kind
  1413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof thing was right in his line.
  1414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe got to hanging around the widow’s too much and so she told him at
  1416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast that if he didn’t quit using around there she would make trouble
  1417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor him. Well, _wasn’t_ he mad?  He said he would show who was Huck
  1418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFinn’s boss.  So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and
  1419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcatched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and
  1420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn’t
  1421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick
  1422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou couldn’t find it if you didn’t know where it was.
  1423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.
  1425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the
  1426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkey under his head nights.  He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,
  1427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.  Every little
  1428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhile he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the
  1429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got
  1430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk and had a good time, and licked me.  The widow she found out where
  1431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but
  1432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpap drove him off with the gun, and it warn’t long after that till I was
  1433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.
  1434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking
  1436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand fishing, and no books nor study.  Two months or more run along, and
  1437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn’t see how I’d ever
  1438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to like it so well at the widow’s, where you had to wash, and eat on
  1439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever
  1440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the
  1441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime.  I didn’t want to go back no more.  I had stopped cussing, because
  1442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe widow didn’t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn’t
  1443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno objections.  It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it
  1444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall around.
  1445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut by and by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I couldn’t stand
  1447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. I was all over welts.  He got to going away so much, too, and
  1448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlocking me in.  Once he locked me in and was gone three days.  It was
  1449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdreadful lonesome.  I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn’t ever
  1450	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to get out any more.  I was scared.  I made up my mind I would fix
  1451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup some way to leave there.  I had tried to get out of that cabin many
  1452	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta time, but I couldn’t find no way.  There warn’t a window to it big
  1453	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough for a dog to get through.  I couldn’t get up the chimbly; it
  1454	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas too narrow.  The door was thick, solid oak slabs.  Pap was pretty
  1455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcareful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;
  1456	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I
  1457	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in
  1458	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe time.  But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty
  1459	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the
  1460	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work.  There was an
  1461	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin
  1462	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and
  1463	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tputting the candle out.  I got under the table and raised the blanket,
  1464	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough
  1465	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto let me through.  Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting
  1466	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods.  I got rid of
  1467	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty
  1468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon pap come in.
  1469	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1470	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPap warn’t in a good humor--so he was his natural self.  He said he was
  1471	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown town, and everything was going wrong.  His lawyer said he reckoned
  1472	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on
  1473	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge
  1474	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there’d be
  1475	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
  1476	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tguardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  This shook me up
  1477	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more
  1478	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.  Then the old man
  1479	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,
  1480	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any,
  1481	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,
  1482	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tincluding a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the names
  1483	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and went
  1484	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright along with his cussing.
  1485	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1486	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe said he would like to see the widow get me.  He said he would watch
  1487	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place
  1488	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsix or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
  1489	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped and they couldn’t find me.  That made me pretty uneasy again,
  1490	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand till he got
  1491	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat chance.
  1492	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1493	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had
  1494	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,
  1495	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two
  1496	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnewspapers for wadding, besides some tow.  I toted up a load, and went
  1497	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.  I thought it all
  1498	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and
  1499	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake to the woods when I run away.  I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one
  1500	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and
  1501	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor
  1502	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe widow couldn’t ever find me any more.  I judged I would saw out and
  1503	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.  I
  1504	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the old
  1505	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.
  1506	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1507	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.  While
  1508	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of
  1509	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarmed up, and went to ripping again.  He had been drunk over in town,
  1510	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.  A body
  1511	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud.  Whenever his liquor
  1512	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:
  1513	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1514	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s like.
  1515	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHere’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away from him--a
  1516	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety
  1517	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all the expense of raising.  Yes, just as that man has got that
  1518	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tson raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin’ for
  1519	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him.  And they call
  1520	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_that_ govment!  That ain’t all, nuther.  The law backs that old Judge
  1521	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher up and helps him to keep me out o’ my property.  Here’s what
  1522	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe law does:  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and
  1523	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup’ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets
  1524	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim go round in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. They call that
  1525	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgovment!  A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes
  1526	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,
  1527	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I _told_ ‘em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face.  Lots of ‘em
  1528	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard me, and can tell what I said.  Says I, for two cents I’d leave the
  1529	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblamed country and never come a-near it agin.  Them’s the very words.  I
  1530	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the
  1531	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trest of it goes down till it’s below my chin, and then it ain’t rightly
  1532	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o’
  1533	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstove-pipe.  Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the
  1534	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.
  1535	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1536	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.  Why, looky here.
  1537	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as
  1538	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta white man.  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the
  1539	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s got as fine
  1540	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
  1541	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsilver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.  And
  1542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat do you think?  They said he was a p’fessor in a college, and could
  1543	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.  And that ain’t the
  1544	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home.  Well, that let me
  1545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to?  It was ‘lection day,
  1546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to get
  1547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere; but when they told me there was a State in this country where
  1548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d let that nigger vote, I drawed out.  I says I’ll never vote agin.
  1549	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Them’s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may
  1550	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trot for all me--I’ll never vote agin as long as I live.  And to see the
  1551	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn’t a give me the road if I hadn’t
  1552	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoved him out o’ the way.  I says to the people, why ain’t this nigger
  1553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput up at auction and sold?--that’s what I want to know.  And what do you
  1554	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon they said? Why, they said he couldn’t be sold till he’d been in
  1555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe State six months, and he hadn’t been there that long yet.  There,
  1556	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow--that’s a specimen.  They call that a govment that can’t sell a free
  1557	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger till he’s been in the State six months.  Here’s a govment that
  1558	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a
  1559	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgovment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six whole months before
  1560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free
  1561	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger, and--”
  1562	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1563	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was
  1564	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttaking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and
  1565	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbarked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind
  1566	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
  1567	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe tub some, too, all along, here and there.  He hopped around the
  1568	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding
  1569	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his
  1570	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleft foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.  But it
  1571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his
  1572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that
  1573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfairly made a body’s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and
  1574	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over
  1575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything he had ever done previous.  He said so his own self afterwards.
  1576	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid
  1577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.
  1578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there
  1580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor two drunks and one delirium tremens.  That was always his word.  I
  1581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
  1582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe key, or saw myself out, one or t’other.  He drank and drank, and
  1583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn’t run my way.
  1584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneasy.  He groaned and moaned and
  1585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrashed around this way and that for a long time.  At last I got so
  1586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I
  1587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.
  1588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an
  1590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawful scream and I was up.  There was pap looking wild, and skipping
  1591	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround every which way and yelling about snakes.  He said they was
  1592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say
  1593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn’t see no snakes.  He started
  1594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off! take him
  1595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff! he’s biting me on the neck!”  I never see a man look so wild in the
  1596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he
  1597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,
  1598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and
  1599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying there was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and by, and laid
  1600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill a while, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound.
  1601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it
  1602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseemed terrible still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by he
  1603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traised up part way and listened, with his head to one side.  He says,
  1604	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery low:
  1605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tramp--tramp--tramp; that’s the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they’re coming
  1607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter me; but I won’t go.  Oh, they’re here! don’t touch me--don’t! hands
  1608	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff--they’re cold; let go.  Oh, let a poor devil alone!”
  1609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
  1611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
  1612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I could
  1613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear him through the blanket.
  1614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he
  1616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee me and went for me.  He chased me round and round the place with a
  1617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
  1618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then I couldn’t come for him no more.  I begged, and told him I
  1619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and
  1620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcussed, and kept on chasing me up.  Once when I turned short and
  1621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
  1622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick
  1623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and
  1624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a
  1625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would
  1626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.
  1627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he dozed off pretty soon.  By and by I got the old split-bottom chair
  1629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the
  1630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgun.  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I
  1631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down
  1632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind it to wait for him to stir.  And how slow and still the time did
  1633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrag along.
  1634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER VII.
  1639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“GIT up!  What you ‘bout?”
  1641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was.  It
  1643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.  Pap was standing over me
  1644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooking sour and sick, too.  He says:
  1645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What you doin’ with this gun?”
  1647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:
  1649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”
  1651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why didn’t you roust me out?”
  1653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.”
  1655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, all right.  Don’t stand there palavering all day, but out with
  1657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou and see if there’s a fish on the lines for breakfast.  I’ll be along
  1658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a minute.”
  1659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.  I noticed
  1661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of
  1662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.  I reckoned I would have
  1663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat times now if I was over at the town.  The June rise used to be
  1664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes
  1665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs
  1666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
  1667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twood-yards and the sawmill.
  1668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one out
  1670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor what the rise might fetch along.  Well, all at once here comes a
  1671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcanoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding
  1672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thigh like a duck.  I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,
  1673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.  I just expected
  1674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that
  1675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they’d
  1676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traise up and laugh at him.  But it warn’t so this time.  It was a
  1677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks
  1678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she’s worth ten dollars.
  1679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight yet, and as I was running
  1680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and
  1681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twillows, I struck another idea:  I judged I’d hide her good, and then,
  1682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I’d go down the river
  1683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a
  1684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trough time tramping on foot.
  1685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man
  1687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around
  1688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just
  1689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrawing a bead on a bird with his gun.  So he hadn’t seen anything.
  1690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line.  He abused
  1692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and
  1693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was what made me so long.  I knowed he would see I was wet, and
  1694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen he would be asking questions.  We got five catfish off the lines
  1695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand went home.
  1696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about
  1698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap
  1699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing
  1700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you
  1701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee, all kinds of things might happen.  Well, I didn’t see no way for a
  1702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhile, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
  1703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater, and he says:
  1704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you
  1706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear? That man warn’t here for no good.  I’d a shot him.  Next time you
  1707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troust me out, you hear?”
  1708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been
  1710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying give me the very idea I wanted.  I says to myself, I can fix it
  1711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow so nobody won’t think of following me.
  1712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout twelve o’clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  The
  1714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the
  1715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.
  1716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.
  1717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch
  1718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style.  Nine logs was enough for one
  1719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and
  1720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.
  1721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I judged he wouldn’t come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he
  1722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that
  1723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlog again.  Before he was t’other side of the river I was out of the
  1724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.
  1725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and
  1727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same
  1728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and
  1729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the
  1730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two
  1731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and
  1732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmatches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned
  1733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn’t any, only the one out
  1734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched
  1735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout the gun, and now I was done.
  1736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
  1738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside
  1739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the
  1740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two
  1741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up
  1742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat that place and didn’t quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five
  1743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot away and didn’t know it was sawed, you wouldn’t never notice
  1744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn’t likely
  1745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody would go fooling around there.
  1746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn’t left a track.  I
  1748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfollowed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the
  1749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,
  1750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon
  1751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie
  1752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfarms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.
  1753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it
  1755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly
  1756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down
  1757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,
  1758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks
  1759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to
  1760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and
  1761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been
  1762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he
  1763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy
  1764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttouches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as
  1765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat.
  1766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
  1768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I
  1769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn’t
  1770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into
  1771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag
  1772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.
  1773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the
  1774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on the
  1775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then
  1776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through
  1777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide
  1778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There
  1779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went
  1780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiles away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river.  The meal
  1781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped
  1782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by
  1783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it
  1784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.
  1785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
  1787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twillows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I
  1788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid
  1789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,
  1790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then
  1791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrag the river for me.  And they’ll follow that meal track to the lake
  1792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers
  1793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat killed me and took the things.  They won’t ever hunt the river for
  1794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything but my dead carcass. They’ll soon get tired of that, and won’t
  1795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.
  1796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJackson’s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,
  1797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,
  1798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson’s Island’s the
  1799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace.
  1800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When
  1802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI woke up I didn’t know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked
  1803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and
  1804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs
  1805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from
  1806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.
  1807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou know what I mean--I don’t know the words to put it in.
  1808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start
  1810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I
  1811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
  1812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toars working in rowlocks when it’s a still night.  I peeped out through
  1813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.
  1814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I couldn’t tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was
  1815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabreast of me I see there warn’t but one man in it.  Think’s I, maybe
  1816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s pap, though I warn’t expecting him.  He dropped below me with the
  1817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcurrent, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,
  1818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.
  1819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his
  1820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toars.
  1821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream
  1823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,
  1824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of
  1825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and
  1826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and
  1827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.
  1828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking
  1830	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when
  1831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.
  1832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people
  1833	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word
  1834	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short
  1835	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnights now.  T’other one said _this_ warn’t one of the short ones, he
  1836	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they
  1837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and
  1838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughed, but he didn’t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said
  1839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlet him alone.  The first fellow said he ‘lowed to tell it to his
  1840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn’t
  1841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it
  1842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas nearly three o’clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn’t wait more than
  1843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,
  1844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I couldn’t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,
  1845	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.
  1846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson’s
  1848	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIsland, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and
  1849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstanding up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like
  1850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta steamboat without any lights.  There warn’t any signs of the bar at
  1851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe head--it was all under water now.
  1852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt didn’t take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping
  1854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and
  1855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlanded on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into
  1856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow
  1857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbranches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
  1858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the outside.
  1859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked
  1861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,
  1862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A
  1863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmonstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,
  1864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,
  1865	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern
  1866	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toars, there! heave her head to stabboard!”  I heard that just as plain
  1867	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas if the man was by my side.
  1868	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1869	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and
  1870	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid down for a nap before breakfast.
  1871	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1872	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  1874	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER VIII.
  1876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
  1878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
  1879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I
  1880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees
  1881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places
  1882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the
  1883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfreckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little
  1884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me
  1885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery friendly.
  1886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn’t want to get up and cook
  1888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
  1889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsound of “boom!” away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow
  1890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and
  1891	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying
  1892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the
  1893	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the
  1894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmatter now.  “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat’s
  1895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my
  1896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarcass come to the top.
  1897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a fire,
  1899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the
  1900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,
  1901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good
  1902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to
  1903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in
  1904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the
  1905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I’ll keep a lookout, and
  1906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif any of them’s floating around after me I’ll give them a show.  I
  1907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchanged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could
  1908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave, and I warn’t disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I
  1909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out
  1910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the
  1911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,
  1912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab
  1913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was “baker’s bread”--what the
  1914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.
  1915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
  1917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And
  1918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson
  1919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone
  1920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand done it.  So there ain’t no doubt but there is something in that
  1921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing--that is, there’s something in it when a body like the widow or the
  1922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tparson prays, but it don’t work for me, and I reckon it don’t work for
  1923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly just the right kind.
  1924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The
  1926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I’d have a chance
  1927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in
  1928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclose, where the bread did.  When she’d got pretty well along down
  1929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,
  1930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where
  1931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe log forked I could peep through.
  1932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could
  1934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.
  1935	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom
  1936	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.
  1937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and
  1938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  1939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he’s
  1941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge.  I
  1942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thope so, anyway.”
  1943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly
  1945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see
  1946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem first-rate, but they couldn’t see me.  Then the captain sung out:
  1947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that
  1949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and
  1950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged I was gone.  If they’d a had some bullets in, I reckon they’d
  1951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn’t hurt, thanks to
  1952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
  1953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and
  1954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn’t hear it no more.
  1955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and
  1956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas giving it up.  But they didn’t yet a while.  They turned around
  1957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,
  1958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over
  1959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the
  1960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tisland they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and
  1961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent home to the town.
  1962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after
  1964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
  1965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
  1966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder so the rain couldn’t get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled
  1967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had
  1968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsupper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.
  1969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
  1971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set
  1972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the
  1973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;
  1974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere ain’t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you
  1975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t stay so, you soon get over it.
  1976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.
  1978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was
  1979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know
  1980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty
  1981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstrawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
  1982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trazberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They
  1983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould all come handy by and by, I judged.
  1984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn’t
  1986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfar from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn’t shot
  1987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh
  1988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thome. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,
  1989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after
  1990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I
  1991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.
  1992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look
  1994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as
  1995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
  1996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t hear
  1997	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;
  1998	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod
  1999	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my
  2000	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.
  2001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t much sand
  2003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling around.  So I
  2004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,
  2005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an
  2006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree.
  2007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing,
  2009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a
  2010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthousand things.  Well, I couldn’t stay up there forever; so at last I
  2011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the
  2012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from
  2013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast.
  2014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good
  2016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
  2017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIllinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and
  2018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there
  2019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says
  2020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices.  I got
  2021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping
  2022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn’t got far when I
  2023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear a man say:
  2024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about
  2026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeat out.  Let’s look around.”
  2027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the
  2029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.
  2030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t sleep much.  I couldn’t, somehow, for thinking.  And every time
  2032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn’t
  2033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can’t live this way; I’m
  2034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-going to find out who it is that’s here on the island with me; I’ll
  2035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfind it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.
  2036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and
  2038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was
  2039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.
  2040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound
  2041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A
  2042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying
  2043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung
  2044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge
  2045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the
  2046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket
  2047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,
  2048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards
  2049	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two
  2050	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto listen.  But I hadn’t no luck somehow; I couldn’t seem to find the
  2051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away
  2052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was
  2053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclose enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It
  2054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his
  2055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in
  2056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting
  2057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove
  2058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff the blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim!  I bet I was glad to see
  2059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.  I says:
  2060	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2061	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.
  2062	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2063	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,
  2064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand puts his hands together and says:
  2065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Doan’ hurt me--don’t!  I hain’t ever done no harm to a ghos’.  I alwuz
  2067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tliked dead people, en done all I could for ‘em.  You go en git in de
  2068	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver agin, whah you b’longs, en doan’ do nuffn to Ole Jim, ‘at ‘uz

  2070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead.  I was ever so
  2072	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tglad to see Jim.  I warn’t lonesome now.  I told him I warn’t afraid of
  2073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set
  2074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:
  2075	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s good daylight.  Le’s get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.”
  2077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich
  2079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttruck? But you got a gun, hain’t you?  Den we kin git sumfn better den
  2080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstrawbries.”
  2081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Strawberries and such truck,” I says.  “Is that what you live on?”
  2083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2084	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says.
  2085	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2086	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”
  2087	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2088	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I come heah de night arter you’s killed.”
  2089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What, all that time?”
  2091	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2092	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--indeedy.”
  2093	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”
  2095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah--nuffn else.”
  2097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?”
  2099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reck’n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on de
  2101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tislan’?”
  2102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Since the night I got killed.”
  2104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No!  W’y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you got
  2106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta gun.  Dat’s good.  Now you kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.”
  2107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in
  2109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and
  2110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the
  2111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done
  2112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him
  2113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith his knife, and fried him.
  2114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.
  2116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then
  2117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  By and by
  2118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim says:
  2119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ‘uz killed in dat shanty ef it
  2121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t you?”
  2122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.  He said Tom
  2124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had.  Then I says:
  2125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”
  2127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute.  Then he
  2129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  2130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe I better not tell.”
  2132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Jim?”
  2134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, dey’s reasons.  But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you,
  2136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould you, Huck?”
  2137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blamed if I would, Jim.”
  2139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck.  I--_I run off_.”
  2141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Jim!”
  2143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell--you know you said you wouldn’ tell,

  2146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  2327	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER IX.
  2328	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2329	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
  2330	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat I’d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,
  2331	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
  2332	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twide.
  2333	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2334	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
  2335	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thigh. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
  2336	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
  2337	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the
  2338	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
  2339	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in
  2340	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
  2341	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.
  2342	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2343	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps
  2344	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,
  2345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them
  2346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to
  2347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget wet?
  2348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,
  2350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by
  2351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off
  2352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.
  2353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
  2355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a
  2356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.
  2357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.
  2359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty
  2360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was
  2361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,
  2362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular
  2363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsummer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black
  2364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toutside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that
  2365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would
  2366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the
  2367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would
  2368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfollow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
  2369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and
  2370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you’d have a little
  2371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tglimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,
  2372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again
  2373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a second, and now you’d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,
  2374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the
  2375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where
  2376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.
  2377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Jim, this is nice,” I says.  “I wouldn’t want to be nowhere else but
  2379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.”
  2380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you wouldn’t a ben here ‘f it hadn’t a ben for Jim.  You’d a ben
  2382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn’ mos’ drownded, too;
  2383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdat you would, honey.  Chickens knows when it’s gwyne to rain, en so do
  2384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tde birds, chile.”
  2385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at
  2387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on
  2388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side
  2389	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same
  2390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a
  2391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twall of high bluffs.
  2392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool
  2394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We
  2395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung
  2396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old
  2397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbroken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and
  2398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
  2399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccount of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your
  2400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would
  2401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.
  2402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe could a had pets enough if we’d wanted them.
  2403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.
  2405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and
  2406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We
  2407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;
  2408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe didn’t show ourselves in daylight.
  2409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
  2411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdaylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was
  2412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got
  2413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,
  2414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.
  2415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then
  2417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and
  2418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there
  2419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the
  2420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfloor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:
  2421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, you!”
  2423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut it didn’t budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:
  2425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“De man ain’t asleep--he’s dead.  You hold still--I’ll go en see.”
  2427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe went, and bent down and looked, and says:
  2429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a dead man.  Yes, indeedy; naked, too.  He’s ben shot in de back.
  2431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reck’n he’s ben dead two er three days.  Come in, Huck, but doan’ look
  2432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat his face--it’s too gashly.”
  2433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but
  2435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the needn’t done it; I didn’t want to see him.  There was heaps of old
  2436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgreasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,
  2437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls
  2438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.
  2439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some
  2440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twomen’s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men’s clothing,
  2441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo.  We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.  There was a
  2442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboy’s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there
  2443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a
  2444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbaby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was
  2445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They
  2446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood open, but there warn’t nothing left in them that was any account.
  2447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a
  2448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurry, and warn’t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.
  2449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2450	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and
  2451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow
  2452	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
  2453	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and
  2454	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet
  2455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some
  2456	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmonstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,
  2457	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t have no label
  2458	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,
  2459	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps
  2460	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though
  2461	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn’t find
  2462	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe other one, though we hunted all around.
  2463	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2464	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready to
  2465	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty
  2466	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbroad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the
  2467	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
  2468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most
  2469	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta half a mile doing it.  I crept up the dead water under the bank, and
  2470	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thadn’t no accidents and didn’t see nobody.  We got home all safe.
  2471	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  2473	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2474	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2475	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER X.
  2476	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2477	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
  2478	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome to be killed, but Jim didn’t want to.  He said it would fetch bad
  2479	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tluck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha’nt us; he said a man
  2480	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat warn’t buried was more likely to go a-ha’nting around than one
  2481	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was planted and comfortable.  That sounded pretty reasonable, so
  2482	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t say no more; but I couldn’t keep from studying over it and
  2483	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.
  2484	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2485	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe rummaged the clothes we’d got, and found eight dollars in silver
  2486	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.  Jim said he reckoned
  2487	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe people in that house stole the coat, because if they’d a knowed the
  2488	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney was there they wouldn’t a left it.  I said I reckoned they killed
  2489	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, too; but Jim didn’t want to talk about that.  I says:
  2490	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2491	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now you think it’s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the
  2492	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?
  2493	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin
  2494	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith my hands.  Well, here’s your bad luck!  We’ve raked in all this
  2495	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttruck and eight dollars besides.  I wish we could have some bad luck
  2496	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike this every day, Jim.”
  2497	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2498	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never you mind, honey, never you mind.  Don’t you git too peart.  It’s
  2499	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-comin’.  Mind I tell you, it’s a-comin’.”
  2500	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2501	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt did come, too.  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.  Well, after
  2502	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
  2503	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tridge, and got out of tobacco.  I went to the cavern to get some, and
  2504	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfound a rattlesnake in there.  I killed him, and curled him up on the
  2505	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot of Jim’s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there’d be some fun
  2506	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen Jim found him there.  Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,
  2507	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light
  2508	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe snake’s mate was there, and bit him.
  2509	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2510	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the
  2511	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvarmint curled up and ready for another spring.  I laid him out in a
  2512	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecond with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap’s whisky-jug and begun to pour
  2513	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit down.
  2514	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2515	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  That all
  2516	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave
  2517	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  Jim told
  2518	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the
  2519	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbody and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said it
  2520	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around
  2521	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet
  2522	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t going
  2523	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
  2524	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2525	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his
  2526	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he
  2527	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent to sucking at the jug again.  His foot swelled up pretty big, and
  2528	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged
  2529	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s
  2530	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhisky.
  2531	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2532	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim was laid up for four days and nights.  Then the swelling was all
  2533	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone and he was around again.  I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take
  2534	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come
  2535	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.  And he said
  2536	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn’t
  2537	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his
  2538	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleft shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin
  2539	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I’ve
  2540	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is
  2541	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank
  2542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he
  2543	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so
  2544	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him
  2545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tedgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so
  2546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey say, but I didn’t see it.  Pap told me.  But anyway it all come of
  2547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooking at the moon that way, like a fool.
  2548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2549	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
  2550	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big
  2551	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was
  2552	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two
  2553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us
  2554	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around
  2555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round
  2556	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,
  2557	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand there was a spool in it.  Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to
  2558	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever
  2559	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcatched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn’t ever seen
  2560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.
  2561	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house
  2562	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes
  2563	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta good fry.
  2564	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2565	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
  2566	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstirring up some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and
  2567	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfind out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I
  2568	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmust go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,
  2569	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?
  2570	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico
  2571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim
  2572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the
  2573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in
  2574	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said
  2575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around
  2576	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty
  2577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell in them, only Jim said I didn’t walk like a girl; and he said
  2578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.  I took
  2579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice, and done better.
  2580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.
  2582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
  2584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.  I
  2585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttied up and started along the bank.  There was a light burning in a
  2586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle shanty that hadn’t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
  2587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twho had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at the
  2588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twindow.  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by
  2589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta candle that was on a pine table.  I didn’t know her face; she was a
  2590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstranger, for you couldn’t start a face in that town that I didn’t know.
  2591	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had
  2592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome; people might know my voice and find me out.  But if this woman had
  2593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to
  2594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn’t forget I
  2595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a girl.

  2601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“COME in,” says the woman, and I did.  She says:  “Take a cheer.”
  2603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2604	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done it.  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:
  2605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What might your name be?”
  2607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2608	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sarah Williams.”
  2609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where ‘bouts do you live?  In this neighborhood?’
  2611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m.  In Hookerville, seven mile below.  I’ve walked all the way and
  2613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’m all tired out.”
  2614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hungry, too, I reckon.  I’ll find you something.”
  2616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m, I ain’t hungry.  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below
  2618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there at a farm; so I ain’t hungry no more.  It’s what makes me so late.
  2619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMy mother’s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to
  2620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell my uncle Abner Moore.  He lives at the upper end of the town, she
  2621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays.  I hain’t ever been here before.  Do you know him?”
  2622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No; but I don’t know everybody yet.  I haven’t lived here quite two
  2624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tweeks. It’s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town.  You
  2625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter stay here all night.  Take off your bonnet.”
  2626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” I says; “I’ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.  I ain’t afeared
  2628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the dark.”
  2629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe said she wouldn’t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in
  2631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she’d send him along with me.
  2632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up
  2633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better
  2634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff they used to was, and how they didn’t know but they’d made a mistake
  2635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,
  2636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what
  2637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the
  2638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmurder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.
  2639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only
  2640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what
  2641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.  I
  2642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  2643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who done it?  We’ve heard considerable about these goings on down in
  2645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHookerville, but we don’t know who ‘twas that killed Huck Finn.”
  2646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people _here_ that’d
  2648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike to know who killed him.  Some think old Finn done it himself.”
  2649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--is that so?”
  2651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Most everybody thought it at first.  He’ll never know how nigh he come
  2653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto getting lynched.  But before night they changed around and judged it
  2654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas done by a runaway nigger named Jim.”
  2655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why _he_--”
  2657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI stopped.  I reckoned I better keep still.  She run on, and never
  2659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnoticed I had put in at all:
  2660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.  So there’s a
  2662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treward out for him--three hundred dollars.  And there’s a reward out for
  2663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told Finn, too--two hundred dollars.  You see, he come to town the
  2664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmorning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with ‘em on the
  2665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.  Before night they
  2666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.  Well, next day they
  2667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfound out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence
  2668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tten o’clock the night the murder was done.  So then they put it on him,
  2669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,
  2670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the
  2671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening
  2672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
  2673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.  Well, he hain’t
  2674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till this thing
  2675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
  2676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’d get
  2677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck’s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
  2678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t People do say he warn’t any too good to do it.  Oh, he’s sly, I reckon.
  2679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t If he don’t come back for a year he’ll be all right.  You can’t prove
  2680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and
  2681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’ll walk in Huck’s money as easy as nothing.”
  2682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I reckon so, ‘m.  I don’t see nothing in the way of it.  Has
  2684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody quit thinking the nigger done it?”
  2685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, no, not everybody.  A good many thinks he done it.  But they’ll get
  2687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.”
  2688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, are they after him yet?”
  2690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you’re innocent, ain’t you!  Does three hundred dollars lay
  2692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround every day for people to pick up?  Some folks think the nigger
  2693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t far from here.  I’m one of them--but I hain’t talked it around.  A
  2694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfew days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in
  2695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to
  2696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat island over yonder that they call Jackson’s Island.  Don’t anybody
  2697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlive there? says I. No, nobody, says they.  I didn’t say any more, but
  2698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done some thinking.  I was pretty near certain I’d seen smoke over
  2699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says
  2700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto myself, like as not that nigger’s hiding over there; anyway, says
  2701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI, it’s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.  I hain’t seen any
  2702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmoke sence, so I reckon maybe he’s gone, if it was him; but husband’s
  2703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing over to see--him and another man.  He was gone up the river; but he
  2704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.”
  2705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had got so uneasy I couldn’t set still.  I had to do something with my
  2707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading
  2708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it.  When the woman
  2709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious
  2710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand smiling a little.  I put down the needle and thread, and let on to
  2711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe interested--and I was, too--and says:
  2712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Three hundred dollars is a power of money.  I wish my mother could get
  2714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. Is your husband going over there to-night?”
  2715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes.  He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a
  2717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboat and see if they could borrow another gun.  They’ll go over after
  2718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight.”
  2719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Couldn’t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?”
  2721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.  And couldn’t the nigger see better, too?  After midnight he’ll
  2723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlikely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up
  2724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this camp fire all the better for the dark, if he’s got one.”
  2725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’t think of that.”
  2727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn’t feel a bit
  2729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable.  Pretty soon she says,
  2730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you say your name was, honey?”
  2732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“M--Mary Williams.”
  2734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSomehow it didn’t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn’t
  2736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,
  2737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.  I wished the woman would
  2738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was.  But
  2739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow she says:
  2740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?”
  2742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes’m, I did.  Sarah Mary Williams.  Sarah’s my first name.  Some
  2744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.”
  2745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that’s the way of it?”
  2747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m.”
  2749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway.  I
  2751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t look up yet.
  2752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
  2754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the
  2755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.  She was right
  2756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout the rats. You’d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
  2757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at
  2758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem when she was alone, or they wouldn’t give her no peace.  She showed
  2759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot
  2760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith it generly, but she’d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn’t
  2761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,
  2762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said
  2763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ouch!” it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to try for the next one.
  2764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course
  2765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his
  2766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnose I let drive, and if he’d a stayed where he was he’d a been a
  2767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I
  2768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched
  2769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help
  2770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and
  2771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent on talking about her and her husband’s matters.  But she broke off
  2772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto say:
  2773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap,
  2775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandy.”
  2776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped
  2778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy legs together on it and she went on talking.  But only about a
  2779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,
  2780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand very pleasant, and says:
  2781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Come, now, what’s your real name?”
  2783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wh--what, mum?”
  2785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s your real name?  Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?”
  2787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn’t know hardly what to do.  But
  2789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  2790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Please to don’t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.  If I’m in the
  2792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway here, I’ll--”
  2793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, you won’t.  Set down and stay where you are.  I ain’t going to hurt
  2795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, and I ain’t going to tell on you, nuther.  You just tell me your
  2796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecret, and trust me.  I’ll keep it; and, what’s more, I’ll help
  2797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou. So’ll my old man if you want him to.  You see, you’re a runaway
  2798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘prentice, that’s all.  It ain’t anything.  There ain’t no harm in it.
  2799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou’ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.  Bless you,
  2800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchild, I wouldn’t tell on you.  Tell me all about it now, that’s a good
  2801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboy.”
  2802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I said it wouldn’t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I
  2804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn’t
  2805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo back on her promise.  Then I told her my father and mother was dead,
  2806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty
  2807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn’t stand it
  2808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my
  2809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchance and stole some of his daughter’s old clothes and cleared out, and
  2810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,
  2811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from
  2812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thome lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my
  2813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck
  2814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout for this town of Goshen.
  2815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Goshen, child?  This ain’t Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen’s
  2817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tten mile further up the river.  Who told you this was Goshen?”
  2818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn
  2820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the woods for my regular sleep.  He told me when the roads forked I
  2821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmust take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.”
  2822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong.”
  2824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain’t no matter now.  I got
  2826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be moving along.  I’ll fetch Goshen before daylight.”
  2827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on a minute.  I’ll put you up a snack to eat.  You might want it.”
  2829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2830	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she put me up a snack, and says:
  2831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, when a cow’s laying down, which end of her gets up first?  Answer
  2833	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup prompt now--don’t stop to study over it.  Which end gets up first?”
  2834	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2835	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The hind end, mum.”
  2836	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, a horse?”
  2838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The for’rard end, mum.”
  2840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?”
  2842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“North side.”
  2844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2845	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with
  2846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir heads pointed the same direction?”
  2847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2848	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The whole fifteen, mum.”
  2849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country.  I thought maybe you
  2851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas trying to hocus me again.  What’s your real name, now?”
  2852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“George Peters, mum.”
  2854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, try to remember it, George.  Don’t forget and tell me it’s
  2856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tElexander before you go, and then get out by saying it’s George
  2857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tElexander when I catch you.  And don’t go about women in that old
  2858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.
  2859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don’t hold the
  2860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and
  2861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpoke the thread at it; that’s the way a woman most always does, but a
  2862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman always does t’other way.  And when you throw at a rat or anything,
  2863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as
  2864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw
  2865	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to
  2866	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out
  2867	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto one side, like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch
  2868	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don’t clap them
  2869	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.  Why, I
  2870	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived
  2871	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe other things just to make certain.  Now trot along to your uncle,
  2872	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble
  2873	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I’ll do what I can
  2874	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto get you out of it.  Keep the river road all the way, and next time
  2875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road’s a rocky one,
  2876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand your feet’ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.”
  2877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks
  2879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.  I
  2880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went up-stream far enough to
  2881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake the head of the island, and then started across.  I took off the
  2882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsun-bonnet, for I didn’t want no blinders on then.  When I was about the
  2883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the
  2884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsound come faint over the water but clear--eleven.  When I struck the
  2885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but
  2886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started
  2887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta good fire there on a high and dry spot.
  2888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half
  2890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow, as hard as I could go.  I landed, and slopped through the timber
  2891	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand up the ridge and into the cavern.  There Jim laid, sound asleep on
  2892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe ground.  I roused him out and says:
  2893	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Git up and hump yourself, Jim!  There ain’t a minute to lose.  They’re
  2895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter us!”
  2896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he
  2898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.  By
  2899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was
  2900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  We
  2901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn’t show a
  2902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle outside after that.
  2903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;
  2905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut if there was a boat around I couldn’t see it, for stars and shadows
  2906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down
  2907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a
  2908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tword.
  2909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XII.
  2914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIT must a been close on to one o’clock when we got below the island at
  2916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to come
  2917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois
  2918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshore; and it was well a boat didn’t come, for we hadn’t ever thought to
  2919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We
  2920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  It warn’t
  2921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.
  2922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIf the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
  2924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbuilt, and watched it all night for Jim to come.  Anyways, they stayed
  2925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn’t no
  2926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfault of mine.  I played it as low down on them as I could.
  2927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
  2929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with
  2930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there
  2931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has
  2932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.
  2933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
  2935	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
  2936	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,
  2937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and
  2938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all
  2939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was
  2940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn’t set
  2941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she’d fetch a dog.  Well, then, I
  2942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, why couldn’t she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he
  2943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he
  2944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelieved they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that
  2945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, or else we wouldn’t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile
  2946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.
  2947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So I said I didn’t care what was the reason they didn’t get us as long
  2948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas they didn’t.
  2949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
  2951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
  2952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug
  2953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things
  2954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above
  2955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of
  2956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a
  2957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlayer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for
  2958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather
  2959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra
  2960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag
  2961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern
  2962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
  2963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t have
  2964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call
  2965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being
  2966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t always run the
  2967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchannel, but hunted easy water.
  2968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
  2970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,
  2971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of
  2972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsolemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
  2973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it
  2974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We
  2975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to
  2976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.
  2977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEvery night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
  2979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The
  2980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
  2981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
  2982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
  2983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspread of lights at two o’clock that still night.  There warn’t a sound
  2984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere; everybody was asleep.
  2985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEvery night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at some little
  2987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvillage, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon or other
  2988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn’t roosting
  2989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when
  2990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou get a chance, because if you don’t want him yourself you can easy
  2991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfind somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t ever forgot.  I never see
  2992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpap when he didn’t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to
  2993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay, anyway.
  2994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
  2996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
  2997	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat kind.  Pap always said it warn’t no harm to borrow things if you
  2998	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn’t
  2999	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
  3000	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
  3001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
  3002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the list and say we wouldn’t borrow them any more--then he reckoned
  3003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit wouldn’t be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all
  3004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds
  3005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,
  3006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and
  3007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconcluded to drop crabapples and p’simmons.  We warn’t feeling just
  3008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way
  3009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit come out, too, because crabapples ain’t ever good, and the p’simmons
  3010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t be ripe for two or three months yet.
  3011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning
  3013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor didn’t go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we
  3014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlived pretty high.
  3015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with
  3017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid
  3018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.
  3019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,
  3020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, “Hel-_lo_, Jim,
  3021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.
  3022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very
  3023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdistinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
  3024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
  3025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,
  3026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the flashes come.
  3027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,
  3029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck
  3030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I
  3031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what
  3032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was there.  So I says:
  3033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Le’s land on her, Jim.”
  3035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:

  3038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I doan’ want to go fool’n ‘long er no wrack.  We’s doin’ blame’ well,
  3039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ten we better let blame’ well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not

  3041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain’t nothing to watch but
  3043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody’s going to resk
  3044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when
  3045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?”  Jim
  3046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t say nothing to that, so he didn’t try.  “And besides,” I says,
  3047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“we might borrow something worth having out of the captain’s stateroom.
  3048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat
  3049	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaptains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don’t
  3050	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcare a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a
  3051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle in your pocket; I can’t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.
  3052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he
  3053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t. He’d call it an adventure--that’s what he’d call it; and he’d
  3054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tland on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn’t he throw style
  3055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto it?--wouldn’t he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you’d think it
  3056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas Christopher C’lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer
  3057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_was_ here.”
  3058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn’t talk any more
  3060	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us
  3061	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and
  3062	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade fast there.
  3063	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to
  3065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlabboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
  3066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfeet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so
  3067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark we couldn’t see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward
  3068	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tend of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in
  3069	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfront of the captain’s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down
  3070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we
  3071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem to hear low voices in yonder!
  3072	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
  3074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just
  3075	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen I heard a voice wail out and say:
  3076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, please don’t, boys; I swear I won’t ever tell!”
  3078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother voice said, pretty loud:
  3080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a lie, Jim Turner.  You’ve acted this way before.  You always want
  3082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore’n your share of the truck, and you’ve always got it, too, because
  3083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve swore ‘t if you didn’t you’d tell.  But this time you’ve said
  3084	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit jest one time too many.  You’re the meanest, treacherousest hound in
  3085	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis country.”
  3086	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3087	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with
  3088	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcuriosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn’t back out now,
  3089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand so I won’t either; I’m a-going to see what’s going on here.  So I
  3090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft
  3091	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the dark till there warn’t but one stateroom betwixt me and the
  3092	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the
  3093	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfloor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one
  3094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.
  3095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t This one kept pointing the pistol at the man’s head on the floor, and
  3096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying:
  3097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’d _like_ to!  And I orter, too--a mean skunk!”
  3099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don’t, Bill;
  3101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hain’t ever goin’ to tell.”
  3102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and
  3104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay:
  3105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Deed you _ain’t!_  You never said no truer thing ‘n that, you bet
  3107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou.” And once he said:  “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn’t got the
  3108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbest of him and tied him he’d a killed us both.  And what _for_?  Jist
  3109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor noth’n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that’s what for.  But
  3110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.  Put
  3111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_up_ that pistol, Bill.”
  3112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBill says:
  3114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t want to, Jake Packard.  I’m for killin’ him--and didn’t he kill
  3116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told Hatfield jist the same way--and don’t he deserve it?”
  3117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But I don’t _want_ him killed, and I’ve got my reasons for it.”
  3119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bless yo’ heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I’ll never forgit you
  3121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong’s I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.
  3122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPackard didn’t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail
  3124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill
  3125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat
  3126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslanted so that I couldn’t make very good time; so to keep from getting
  3127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trun over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.
  3128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my
  3129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstateroom, he says:
  3130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here--come in here.”
  3132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up
  3134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,
  3135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn’t see
  3136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they’d been having.
  3137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I was glad I didn’t drink whisky; but it wouldn’t made much difference
  3138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway, because most of the time they couldn’t a treed me because I
  3139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn’t_
  3140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted
  3141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto kill Turner.  He says:
  3142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He’s said he’ll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both our shares
  3144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto him _now_ it wouldn’t make no difference after the row and the way
  3145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe’ve served him.  Shore’s you’re born, he’ll turn State’s evidence; now
  3146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou hear _me_.  I’m for putting him out of his troubles.”
  3147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet.
  3149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t.  Well, then, that’s all
  3151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright.  Le’s go and do it.”
  3152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on a minute; I hain’t had my say yit.  You listen to me.
  3154	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s _got_ to be
  3155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone. But what I say is this:  it ain’t good sense to go court’n around
  3156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter a halter if you can git at what you’re up to in some way that’s
  3157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjist as good and at the same time don’t bring you into no resks.  Ain’t
  3158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat so?”
  3159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You bet it is.  But how you goin’ to manage it this time?”
  3161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, my idea is this:  we’ll rustle around and gather up whatever
  3163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpickins we’ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide
  3164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe truck. Then we’ll wait.  Now I say it ain’t a-goin’ to be more’n two
  3165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thours befo’ this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?
  3166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe’ll be drownded, and won’t have nobody to blame for it but his own
  3167	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tself.  I reckon that’s a considerble sight better ‘n killin’ of him.
  3168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you can git aroun’ it; it
  3169	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t good sense, it ain’t good morals.  Ain’t I right?”
  3170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I reck’n you are.  But s’pose she _don’t_ break up and wash off?”
  3172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can’t we?”
  3174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, then; come along.”
  3176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled
  3178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse
  3179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a
  3180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoan, and I says:
  3181	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick, Jim, it ain’t no time for fooling around and moaning; there’s a
  3183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgang of murderers in yonder, and if we don’t hunt up their boat and set
  3184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther drifting down the river so these fellows can’t get away from the
  3185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twreck there’s one of ‘em going to be in a bad fix.  But if we find their
  3186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboat we can put _all_ of ‘em in a bad fix--for the sheriff ‘ll get ‘em.
  3187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tQuick--hurry!  I’ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You
  3188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart at the raft, and--”
  3189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, my lordy, lordy!  _raf’_?  Dey ain’ no raf’ no mo’; she done broke
  3191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloose en gone I--en here we is!”
  3192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XIII.
  3197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a wreck with
  3199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch a gang as that!  But it warn’t no time to be sentimentering.  We’d
  3200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  So we went
  3201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,
  3202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jim
  3203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he didn’t believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn’t
  3204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we get left
  3205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.  We struck
  3206	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along
  3207	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the
  3208	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tedge of the skylight was in the water.  When we got pretty close to the
  3209	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  I could just barely
  3210	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee her.  I felt ever so thankful.  In another second I would a been
  3211	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taboard of her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck his
  3212	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;
  3213	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut he jerked it in again, and says:
  3214	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3215	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Heave that blame lantern out o’ sight, Bill!”
  3216	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3217	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and
  3218	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset down.  It was Packard.  Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.  Packard
  3219	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays, in a low voice:
  3220	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3221	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All ready--shove off!”
  3222	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3223	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI couldn’t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But Bill
  3224	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  3225	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3226	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on--‘d you go through him?”
  3227	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3228	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No.  Didn’t you?”
  3229	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3230	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No.  So he’s got his share o’ the cash yet.”
  3231	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3232	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”
  3233	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3234	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, won’t he suspicion what we’re up to?”
  3235	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3236	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe he won’t.  But we got to have it anyway. Come along.”
  3237	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3238	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they got out and went in.
  3239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half
  3241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecond I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.  I out with my
  3242	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknife and cut the rope, and away we went!
  3243	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3244	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe didn’t touch an oar, and we didn’t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even
  3245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreathe.  We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the
  3246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a
  3247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every
  3248	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.
  3249	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3250	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern
  3251	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshow like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed
  3252	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to
  3253	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunderstand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.
  3254	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now was the
  3256	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn’t
  3257	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad time to before.  I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for
  3258	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmurderers, to be in such a fix.  I says to myself, there ain’t no
  3259	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttelling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would
  3260	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI like it?  So says I to Jim:
  3261	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3262	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The first light we see we’ll land a hundred yards below it or above

  3264	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen I’ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for
  3265	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when
  3266	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir time comes.”
  3267	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3268	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,
  3269	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand this time worse than ever.  The rain poured down, and never a light
  3270	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed along down the river,
  3271	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatching for lights and watching for our raft.  After a long time the
  3272	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\train let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,
  3273	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we
  3274	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade for it.
  3275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  We
  3277	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  So I said I would
  3278	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
  3279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere on the wreck.  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told
  3280	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone
  3281	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars
  3282	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand shoved for the light.  As I got down towards it three or four more
  3283	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed--up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in above the shore
  3284	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlight, and laid on my oars and floated.  As I went by I see it was a
  3285	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.  I skimmed
  3286	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and
  3287	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between
  3288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this knees.  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to
  3289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcry.
  3290	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3291	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only
  3292	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:
  3293	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, what’s up?  Don’t cry, bub.  What’s the trouble?”
  3295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  3297	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pap, and mam, and sis, and--”
  3299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I broke down.  He says:
  3301	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3302	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, dang it now, _don’t_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,

  3304	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3305	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They’re--they’re--are you the watchman of the boat?”
  3306	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3307	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  “I’m the captain
  3308	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head
  3309	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeck-hand; and sometimes I’m the freight and passengers.  I ain’t as
  3310	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trich as old Jim Hornback, and I can’t be so blame’ generous and good
  3311	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he
  3312	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoes; but I’ve told him a many a time ‘t I wouldn’t trade places with
  3313	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim; for, says I, a sailor’s life’s the life for me, and I’m derned if
  3314	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_I’d_ live two mile out o’ town, where there ain’t nothing ever goin’

  3316	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3317	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI broke in and says:

  3390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back
  3392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in
  3393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among
  3394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome woodboats; for I couldn’t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat
  3395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on
  3396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would
  3397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta done it.  I wished the widow knowed about it.  I judged she would be
  3398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tproud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and
  3399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest
  3400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin.
  3401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along
  3403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for
  3404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther.  She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn’t much chance
  3405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor anybody being alive in her.  I pulled all around her and hollered
  3406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little, but there wasn’t any answer; all dead still.  I felt a little
  3407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they
  3408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould stand it I could.
  3409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river
  3411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach
  3412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the
  3413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twreck for Miss Hooker’s remainders, because the captain would know her
  3414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give
  3415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming
  3416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the river.
  3417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt did seem a powerful long time before Jim’s light showed up; and when
  3419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.  By the time I
  3420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we
  3421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstruck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned
  3422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin and slept like dead people.

  3428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole
  3430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all
  3431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three
  3432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboxes of seegars.  We hadn’t ever been this rich before in neither of
  3433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tour lives.  The seegars was prime.  We laid off all the afternoon in the
  3434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good
  3435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the
  3436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said
  3437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the didn’t want no more adventures.  He said that when I went in the
  3438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttexas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he
  3439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could
  3440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe fixed; for if he didn’t get saved he would get drownded; and if he
  3441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdid get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get
  3442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure.  Well, he
  3443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a
  3444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger.
  3445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and
  3447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each
  3448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, ‘stead
  3449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof mister; and Jim’s eyes bugged out, and he was interested.  He says:

  3451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’ know dey was so many un um.  I hain’t hearn ‘bout none un um,

  3455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Get?”  I says; “why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want

  3468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  3629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XV.
  3630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom
  3632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was
  3633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter.  We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the
  3634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOhio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.
  3635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead
  3637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto tie to, for it wouldn’t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled
  3638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn’t anything
  3639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut little saplings to tie to.  I passed the line around one of them
  3640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and
  3641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and
  3642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway she went.  I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and
  3643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscared I couldn’t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and
  3644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen there warn’t no raft in sight; you couldn’t see twenty yards.  I
  3645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle
  3646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand set her back a stroke.  But she didn’t come.  I was in such a hurry
  3647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hadn’t untied her.  I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so
  3648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texcited my hands shook so I couldn’t hardly do anything with them.
  3649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right
  3651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the towhead.  That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead
  3652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot
  3653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout into the solid white fog, and hadn’t no more idea which way I was
  3654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing than a dead man.
  3655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThinks I, it won’t do to paddle; first I know I’ll run into the bank
  3657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it’s
  3658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time.
  3659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I whooped and listened.  Away down there somewheres I hears a small
  3660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhoop, and up comes my spirits.  I went tearing after it, listening
  3661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsharp to hear it again.  The next time it come I see I warn’t heading
  3662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor it, but heading away to the right of it.  And the next time I was
  3663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for
  3664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was flying around, this way and that and t’other, but it was going
  3665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight ahead all the time.
  3666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the
  3668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops
  3669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was making the trouble for me.  Well, I fought along, and directly
  3670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hears the whoop _behind_ me.  I was tangled good now.  That was
  3671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around.
  3672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI throwed the paddle down.  I heard the whoop again; it was behind me
  3674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its
  3675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,
  3676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream, and I
  3677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.
  3678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t look
  3679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnatural nor sound natural in a fog.
  3680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a
  3682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed
  3683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly
  3684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.
  3685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn another second or two it was solid white and still again.  I set
  3687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn’t
  3688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdraw a breath while it thumped a hundred.
  3689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI just give up then.  I knowed what the matter was.  That cut bank
  3691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas an island, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it.  It warn’t no
  3692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowhead that you could float by in ten minutes.  It had the big timber
  3693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than
  3694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf a mile wide.
  3695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.  I
  3697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t
  3698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever think of that.  No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on
  3699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to
  3700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyourself how fast _you’re_ going, but you catch your breath and think,
  3701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy! how that snag’s tearing along.  If you think it ain’t dismal and
  3702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it
  3703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonce--you’ll see.
  3704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears
  3706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t do
  3707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of towheads, for I had
  3708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow
  3709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchannel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was there because
  3710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash
  3711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat hung over the banks.  Well, I warn’t long loosing the whoops down
  3712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,
  3713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern.  You never
  3714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.
  3715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to
  3717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkeep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the
  3718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would
  3719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little
  3720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfaster than what I was.
  3721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn’t
  3723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear no sign of a whoop nowheres.  I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a
  3724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnag, maybe, and it was all up with him.  I was good and tired, so I
  3725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid down in the canoe and said I wouldn’t bother no more.  I didn’t
  3726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn’t help it;
  3727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.
  3728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars
  3730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a
  3731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig bend stern first.  First I didn’t know where I was; I thought I was
  3732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come
  3733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup dim out of last week.
  3734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest
  3736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see
  3737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby the stars.  I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the
  3738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn’t nothing but a
  3739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of sawlogs made fast together.  Then I see another speck, and
  3740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchased that; then another, and this time I was right.  It was the raft.
  3741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his
  3743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar.  The
  3744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and
  3745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbranches and dirt.  So she’d had a rough time.
  3746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI made fast and laid down under Jim’s nose on the raft, and began to
  3748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:
  3749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?  Why didn’t you stir me up?”
  3751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?  En you ain’ dead--you ain’
  3753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrownded--you’s back agin?  It’s too good for true, honey, it’s too good
  3754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o’ you.  No, you ain’
  3755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead! you’s back agin, ‘live en soun’, jis de same ole Huck--de same ole
  3756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck, thanks to goodness!”
  3757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the matter with you, Jim?  You been a-drinking?”
  3759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Drinkin’?  Has I ben a-drinkin’?  Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin’?”
  3761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?”
  3763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How does I talk wild?”
  3765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_How_?  Why, hain’t you been talking about my coming back, and all that
  3767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstuff, as if I’d been gone away?”
  3768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.  _Hain’t_ you
  3770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tben gone away?”
  3771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gone away?  Why, what in the nation do you mean?  I hain’t been gone
  3773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanywheres.  Where would I go to?”
  3774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, looky here, boss, dey’s sumf’n wrong, dey is.  Is I _me_, or who
  3776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I?  Now dat’s what I wants to know.”
  3777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I think you’re here, plain enough, but I think you’re a
  3779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttangle-headed old fool, Jim.”
  3780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I is, is I?  Well, you answer me dis:  Didn’t you tote out de line in
  3782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tde canoe fer to make fas’ to de tow-head?”
  3783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, I didn’t.  What tow-head?  I hain’t see no tow-head.”
  3785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You hain’t seen no towhead?  Looky here, didn’t de line pull loose en

  3789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What fog?”
  3791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, de fog!--de fog dat’s been aroun’ all night.  En didn’t you whoop,

  3797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanswer me dat.”
  3798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, this is too many for me, Jim.  I hain’t seen no fog, nor no
  3800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tislands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.  I been setting here talking with
  3801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon
  3802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done the same.  You couldn’t a got drunk in that time, so of course
  3803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve been dreaming.”
  3804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?”
  3806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn’t any of it
  3808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thappen.”
  3809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But, Huck, it’s all jis’ as plain to me as--”
  3811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It don’t make no difference how plain it is; there ain’t nothing in it.
  3813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI know, because I’ve been here all the time.”
  3814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim didn’t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying
  3816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover it.  Then he says:
  3817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, den, I reck’n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain’t
  3819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tde powerfullest dream I ever see.  En I hain’t ever had no dream b’fo’
  3820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdat’s tired me like dis one.”
  3821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, well, that’s all right, because a dream does tire a body like
  3823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything sometimes.  But this one was a staving dream; tell me all
  3824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it, Jim.”
  3825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as
  3827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit happened, only he painted it up considerable.  Then he said he must
  3828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart in and “‘terpret” it, because it was sent for a warning.  He said
  3829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but
  3830	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe current was another man that would get us away from him.  The whoops
  3831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn’t
  3832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttry hard to make out to understand them they’d just take us into bad
  3833	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tluck, ‘stead of keeping us out of it.  The lot of towheads was troubles
  3834	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean
  3835	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfolks, but if we minded our business and didn’t talk back and aggravate
  3836	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big
  3837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclear river, which was the free States, and wouldn’t have no more
  3838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrouble.
  3839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it
  3841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas clearing up again now.
  3842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, well, that’s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,” I
  3844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays; “but what does _these_ things stand for?”
  3845	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.  You
  3847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould see them first-rate now.
  3848	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash
  3850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain.  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he
  3851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place
  3852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain right away.  But when he did get the thing straightened around he
  3853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:
  3854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do dey stan’ for?  I’se gwyne to tell you.  When I got all wore
  3856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout wid work, en wid de callin’ for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz
  3857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmos’ broke bekase you wuz los’, en I didn’ k’yer no’ mo’ what become
  3858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ter me en de raf’.  En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe
  3859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ten soun’, de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo’
  3860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot, I’s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin’ ‘bout wuz how you could
  3861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie.  Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trash
  3862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren’s en makes ‘em
  3863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tashamed.”
  3864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3865	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without
  3866	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying anything but that.  But that was enough.  It made me feel so mean
  3867	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.
  3868	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3869	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble
  3870	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn’t ever sorry for it
  3871	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafterwards, neither.  I didn’t do him no more mean tricks, and I
  3872	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t done that one if I’d a knowed it would make him feel that way.
  3873	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3874	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVI.
  3878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a
  3880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmonstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.  She had
  3881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfour long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty
  3882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmen, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open
  3883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcamp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a
  3884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpower of style about her.  It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman
  3885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton such a craft as that.
  3886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got
  3888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on
  3889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth sides; you couldn’t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  We
  3890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to
  3891	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.  I said likely we wouldn’t, because I had heard say there warn’t but
  3892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a dozen houses there, and if they didn’t happen to have them lit
  3893	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the two
  3894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybe
  3895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the
  3896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too.  So the question
  3897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,
  3898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and
  3899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to
  3900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCairo.  Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and
  3901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaited.
  3902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere warn’t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and
  3904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot pass it without seeing it.  He said he’d be mighty sure to see it,
  3905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause he’d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it
  3906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.  Every
  3907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle while he jumps up and says:
  3908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dah she is?”
  3910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut it warn’t.  It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set
  3912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown again, and went to watching, same as before.  Jim said it made him
  3913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.  Well, I can
  3914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,
  3915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and
  3916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twho was to blame for it?  Why, _me_.  I couldn’t get that out of my
  3917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t
  3918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trest; I couldn’t stay still in one place.  It hadn’t ever come home to
  3919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme before, what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and it
  3920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make out to
  3921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself that I warn’t to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his
  3922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trightful owner; but it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every
  3923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a
  3924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaddled ashore and told somebody.”  That was so--I couldn’t get around
  3925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat noway.  That was where it pinched.  Conscience says to me, “What
  3926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off
  3927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright under your eyes and never say one single word?  What did that poor
  3928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told woman do to you that you could treat her so mean?  Why, she tried to
  3929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlearn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to
  3930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe good to you every way she knowed how.  _That’s_ what she done.”
  3931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.  I
  3933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was
  3934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfidgeting up and down past me.  We neither of us could keep still.
  3935	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Every time he danced around and says, “Dah’s Cairo!” it went through me
  3936	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of
  3937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiserableness.
  3938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself.  He was
  3940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
  3941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he
  3942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to
  3943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the
  3944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo children, and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get an
  3945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAb’litionist to go and steal them.
  3946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt most froze me to hear such talk.  He wouldn’t ever dared to talk such
  3948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk in his life before.  Just see what a difference it made in him the
  3949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute he judged he was about free.  It was according to the old saying,
  3950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an ell.”  Thinks I, this is what
  3951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes of my not thinking.  Here was this nigger, which I had as good
  3952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would
  3953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn’t even know; a
  3954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman that hadn’t ever done me no harm.
  3955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.  My
  3957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says
  3958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto it, “Let up on me--it ain’t too late yet--I’ll paddle ashore at the
  3959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst light and tell.”  I felt easy and happy and light as a feather
  3960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright off.  All my troubles was gone.  I went to looking out sharp for a
  3961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlight, and sort of singing to myself.  By and by one showed.  Jim sings
  3962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout:
  3963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We’s safe, Huck, we’s safe!  Jump up and crack yo’ heels!  Dat’s de
  3965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood ole Cairo at las’, I jis knows it!”
  3966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  3968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim.  It mightn’t be, you know.”
  3970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom
  3972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:
  3973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en I’ll say, it’s all on
  3975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I couldn’t ever ben free ef it
  3976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thadn’ ben for Huck; Huck done it.  Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck;
  3977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de _only_ fren’ ole Jim’s
  3978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot now.”
  3979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says
  3981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.  I went along
  3982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslow then, and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I started
  3983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor whether I warn’t.  When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:
  3984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’ his
  3986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpromise to ole Jim.”
  3987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I just felt sick.  But I says, I _got_ to do it--I can’t get _out_
  3989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it.  Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and
  3990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey stopped and I stopped.  One of them says:
  3991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s that yonder?”
  3993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A piece of a raft,” I says.
  3995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you belong on it?”
  3997	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3998	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, sir.”
  3999	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4000	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Any men on it?”
  4001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Only one, sir.”
  4003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head
  4005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the bend.  Is your man white or black?”
  4006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t answer up prompt.  I tried to, but the words wouldn’t come. I
  4008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn’t man
  4009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough--hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit.  I see I was weakening; so I just
  4010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive up trying, and up and says:
  4011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He’s white.”
  4013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves.”
  4015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wish you would,” says I, “because it’s pap that’s there, and maybe
  4017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.  He’s sick--and so
  4018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis mam and Mary Ann.”
  4019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, the devil! we’re in a hurry, boy.  But I s’pose we’ve got to.
  4021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Come, buckle to your paddle, and let’s get along.”
  4022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.  When we had made a
  4024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstroke or two, I says:
  4025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pap’ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.  Everybody goes
  4027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can’t do it
  4028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby myself.”
  4029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s infernal mean.  Odd, too.  Say, boy, what’s the matter
  4031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith your father?”
  4032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s the--a--the--well, it ain’t anything much.”
  4034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey stopped pulling.  It warn’t but a mighty little ways to the raft
  4036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow. One says:
  4037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Boy, that’s a lie.  What _is_ the matter with your pap?  Answer up
  4039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsquare now, and it’ll be the better for you.”
  4040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I will, sir, I will, honest--but don’t leave us, please.  It’s
  4042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe--the--Gentlemen, if you’ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the
  4043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theadline, you won’t have to come a-near the raft--please do.”
  4044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one.  They backed water.  “Keep
  4046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway, boy--keep to looard.  Confound it, I just expect the wind has
  4047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblowed it to us.  Your pap’s got the small-pox, and you know it precious
  4048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell.  Why didn’t you come out and say so?  Do you want to spread it all
  4049	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover?”
  4050	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I’ve told everybody before, and they just
  4052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent away and left us.”
  4053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Poor devil, there’s something in that.  We are right down sorry for
  4055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, but we--well, hang it, we don’t want the small-pox, you see.  Look
  4056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there, I’ll tell you what to do.  Don’t you try to land by yourself, or
  4057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ll smash everything to pieces.  You float along down about twenty
  4058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiles, and you’ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.  It
  4059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them
  4060	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour folks are all down with chills and fever.  Don’t be a fool again,
  4061	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand let people guess what is the matter.  Now we’re trying to do you a
  4062	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s a good boy.
  4063	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t It wouldn’t do any good to land yonder where the light is--it’s only a
  4064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twood-yard. Say, I reckon your father’s poor, and I’m bound to say he’s
  4065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin pretty hard luck.  Here, I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this
  4066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboard, and you get it when it floats by.  I feel mighty mean to leave
  4067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou; but my kingdom! it won’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t you see?”
  4068	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4069	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here’s a twenty to put on the
  4070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboard for me.  Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you’ll
  4071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe all right.”
  4072	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye.  If you see any runaway niggers
  4074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.”
  4075	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good-bye, sir,” says I; “I won’t let no runaway niggers get by me if I
  4077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan help it.”
  4078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I
  4080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn’t no use for me
  4081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto try to learn to do right; a body that don’t get _started_ right when
  4082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’s little ain’t got no show--when the pinch comes there ain’t nothing
  4083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.  Then I
  4084	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s’pose you’d a done right
  4085	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?  No, says
  4086	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI, I’d feel bad--I’d feel just the same way I do now.  Well, then, says
  4087	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI, what’s the use you learning to do right when it’s troublesome to do
  4088	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright and ain’t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?
  4089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I was stuck.  I couldn’t answer that.  So I reckoned I wouldn’t bother
  4090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at
  4091	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe time.
  4092	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4093	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went into the wigwam; Jim warn’t there.  I looked all around; he
  4094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t anywhere.  I says:
  4095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Jim!”
  4097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here I is, Huck.  Is dey out o’ sight yit?  Don’t talk loud.”
  4099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.  I told
  4101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim they were out of sight, so he come aboard.  He says:
  4102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was a-listenin’ to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne
  4104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto shove for sho’ if dey come aboard.  Den I was gwyne to swim to de
  4105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traf’ agin when dey was gone.  But lawsy, how you did fool ‘em, Huck!
  4106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Dat _wuz_ de smartes’ dodge!  I tell you, chile, I’spec it save’ ole
  4107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim--ole Jim ain’t going to forgit you for dat, honey.”
  4108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we talked about the money.  It was a pretty good raise--twenty
  4110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars apiece.  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat
  4111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free
  4112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tStates. He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go, but he
  4113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twished we was already there.
  4114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding
  4116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe raft good.  Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and
  4117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting all ready to quit rafting.
  4118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down
  4120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a left-hand bend.
  4121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went off in the canoe to ask about it.  Pretty soon I found a man out
  4123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.  I ranged up and says:
  4124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mister, is that town Cairo?”
  4126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cairo? no.  You must be a blame’ fool.”
  4128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What town is it, mister?”
  4130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If you want to know, go and find out.  If you stay here botherin’
  4132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround me for about a half a minute longer you’ll get something you
  4133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t want.”
  4134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI paddled to the raft.  Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never
  4136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.
  4137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but
  4139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was high ground, so I didn’t go.  No high ground about Cairo, Jim
  4140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid. I had forgot it.  We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable
  4141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclose to the left-hand bank.  I begun to suspicion something.  So did
  4142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim.  I says:
  4143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.”
  4145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe says:
  4147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Doan’ le’s talk about it, Huck.  Po’ niggers can’t have no luck.  I
  4149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawluz ‘spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn’t done wid its work.”
  4150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wish I’d never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I’d never laid
  4152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes on it.”
  4153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4154	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t yo’ fault, Huck; you didn’ know.  Don’t you blame yo’self
  4155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘bout it.”
  4156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure
  4158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was all up with
  4159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCairo.
  4160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe talked it all over.  It wouldn’t do to take to the shore; we couldn’t
  4162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn’t no way but to wait
  4163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept
  4164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,
  4165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!
  4166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4167	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe didn’t say a word for a good while.  There warn’t anything to
  4168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay.  We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the
  4169	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?  It would only
  4170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more
  4171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep
  4172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill.
  4173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn’t no
  4175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy
  4176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta canoe to go back in.  We warn’t going to borrow it when there warn’t
  4177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after
  4178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus.
  4179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we shoved out after dark on the raft.

  4182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnybody that don’t believe yet that it’s foolishness to handle a
  4183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it
  4184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow if they read on and see what more it done for us.
  4185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But we
  4187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and
  4188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next
  4189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeanest thing to fog.  You can’t tell the shape of the river, and you
  4190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along
  4191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she
  4192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould see it.  Up-stream boats didn’t generly come close to us; they
  4193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but
  4194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.
  4195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe could hear her pounding along, but we didn’t see her good till she
  4197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas close.  She aimed right for us.  Often they do that and try to see
  4198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off
  4199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks
  4200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’s mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to
  4201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttry and shave us; but she didn’t seem to be sheering off a bit.  She
  4202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black
  4203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged
  4204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining
  4205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right
  4206	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the
  4207	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tengines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went
  4208	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toverboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight
  4209	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the raft.
  4210	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4211	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel
  4212	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.  I could
  4213	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a
  4214	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was
  4215	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of
  4216	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and
  4217	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she
  4218	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was
  4219	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchurning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I
  4220	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould hear her.
  4221	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4222	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn’t get any answer;
  4223	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” and
  4224	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstruck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  But I made out to see
  4225	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which
  4226	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.
  4227	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4228	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good
  4229	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up the
  4230	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbank. I couldn’t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over
  4231	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a
  4232	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going to
  4233	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling
  4234	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.

  4239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVII.
  4240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his
  4242	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead out, and says:
  4243	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4244	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Be done, boys!  Who’s there?”
  4245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  4247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4248	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s me.”
  4249	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4250	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’s me?”
  4251	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4252	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“George Jackson, sir.”
  4253	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4254	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do you want?”
  4255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4256	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t want nothing, sir.  I only want to go along by, but the dogs
  4257	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t let me.”
  4258	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4259	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?”
  4260	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4261	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I warn’t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.”
  4262	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4263	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, you did, did you?  Strike a light there, somebody.  What did you
  4264	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay your name was?”
  4265	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4266	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“George Jackson, sir.  I’m only a boy.”
  4267	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4268	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look here, if you’re telling the truth you needn’t be afraid--nobody’ll
  4269	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurt you.  But don’t try to budge; stand right where you are.  Rouse out
  4270	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns.  George Jackson, is there
  4271	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody with you?”
  4272	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4273	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir, nobody.”
  4274	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.
  4276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe man sung out:
  4277	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4278	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain’t you got any sense?
  4279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPut it on the floor behind the front door.  Bob, if you and Tom are
  4280	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tready, take your places.”
  4281	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4282	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All ready.”
  4283	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4284	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?”
  4285	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4286	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir; I never heard of them.”
  4287	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that may be so, and it mayn’t.  Now, all ready.  Step forward,
  4289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGeorge Jackson.  And mind, don’t you hurry--come mighty slow.  If there’s
  4290	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he’ll be shot.
  4291	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCome along now.  Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to
  4292	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsqueeze in, d’ you hear?”
  4293	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t hurry; I couldn’t if I’d a wanted to.  I took one slow step at
  4295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta time and there warn’t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.
  4296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind
  4297	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and
  4298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunbarring and unbolting.  I put my hand on the door and pushed it a
  4299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle and a little more till somebody said, “There, that’s enough--put
  4300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour head in.” I done it, but I judged they would take it off.
  4301	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4302	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and
  4303	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme at them, for about a quarter of a minute:  Three big men with guns
  4304	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray
  4305	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and
  4306	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two
  4307	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung women which I couldn’t see right well.  The old gentleman says:
  4308	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4309	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There; I reckon it’s all right.  Come in.”
  4310	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4311	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it
  4312	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and
  4313	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,
  4314	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front
  4315	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twindows--there warn’t none on the side.  They held the candle, and took a
  4316	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood look at me, and all said, “Why, _he_ ain’t a Shepherdson--no, there
  4317	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t any Shepherdson about him.”  Then the old man said he hoped I
  4318	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t mind being searched for arms, because he didn’t mean no harm by
  4319	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--it was only to make sure.  So he didn’t pry into my pockets, but only
  4320	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfelt outside with his hands, and said it was all right.  He told me to
  4321	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old
  4322	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlady says:
  4323	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4324	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing’s as wet as he can be; and don’t
  4325	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou reckon it may be he’s hungry?”
  4326	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4327	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“True for you, Rachel--I forgot.”
  4328	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4329	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the old lady says:
  4330	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4331	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Betsy” (this was a nigger woman), “you fly around and get him something
  4332	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake
  4333	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself.  Buck, take this little
  4334	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some
  4335	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof yours that’s dry.”
  4336	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4337	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBuck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,
  4338	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthough he was a little bigger than me.  He hadn’t on anything but a
  4339	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshirt, and he was very frowzy-headed.  He came in gaping and digging one
  4340	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.
  4341	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe says:
  4342	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4343	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ain’t they no Shepherdsons around?”
  4344	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey said, no, ‘twas a false alarm.
  4346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” he says, “if they’d a ben some, I reckon I’d a got one.”
  4348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey all laughed, and Bob says:
  4350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you’ve been so slow in
  4352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming.”
  4353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, nobody come after me, and it ain’t right I’m always kept down; I
  4355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t get no show.”
  4356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “you’ll have show enough,
  4358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall in good time, don’t you fret about that.  Go ‘long with you now, and
  4359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo as your mother told you.”
  4360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
  4362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troundabout and pants of his, and I put them on.  While I was at it he
  4363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to
  4364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods
  4365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle
  4366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent out.  I said I didn’t know; I hadn’t heard about it before, no way.
  4367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, guess,” he says.
  4369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How’m I going to guess,” says I, “when I never heard tell of it
  4371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore?”
  4372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But you can guess, can’t you?  It’s just as easy.”
  4374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Which_ candle?”  I says.
  4376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, any candle,” he says.
  4378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know where he was,” says I; “where was he?”
  4380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, he was in the _dark_!  That’s where he was!”
  4382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?”
  4384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, blame it, it’s a riddle, don’t you see?  Say, how long are you
  4386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to stay here?  You got to stay always.  We can just have booming
  4387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes--they don’t have no school now.  Do you own a dog?  I’ve got a
  4388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdog--and he’ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in.  Do
  4389	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness?  You bet
  4390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI don’t, but ma she makes me.  Confound these ole britches!  I reckon
  4391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d better put ‘em on, but I’d ruther not, it’s so warm.  Are you all
  4392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tready? All right.  Come along, old hoss.”
  4393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they
  4395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad for me down there, and there ain’t nothing better that ever I’ve
  4396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome across yet.  Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,
  4397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texcept the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.  They
  4398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.  The young women had
  4399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquilts around them, and their hair down their backs.  They all asked me
  4400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquestions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living
  4401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann
  4402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trun off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went
  4403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto hunt them and he warn’t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,
  4404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then there warn’t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just
  4405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died
  4406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took what there was left, because the farm didn’t belong to us, and
  4407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how
  4408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI come to be here.  So they said I could have a home there as long as I
  4409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted it.  Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I
  4410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,
  4411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to
  4412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthink, and when Buck waked up I says:
  4413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Can you spell, Buck?”
  4415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” he says.
  4417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet you can’t spell my name,” says I.
  4419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet you what you dare I can,” says he.
  4421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right,” says I, “go ahead.”
  4423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,” he says.
  4425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says I, “you done it, but I didn’t think you could.  It ain’t no
  4427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.”
  4428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it
  4430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnext, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was
  4431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to it.
  4432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.  I hadn’t
  4434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
  4435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstyle.  It didn’t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one
  4436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in
  4437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttown. There warn’t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps
  4438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that
  4439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by
  4440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes
  4441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,
  4442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold
  4443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with
  4444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and
  4445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the
  4446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpendulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;
  4447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her
  4448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred
  4449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand fifty before she got tuckered out.  They wouldn’t took any money for
  4450	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther.
  4451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4452	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,
  4453	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.  By one of the
  4454	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tparrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;
  4455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open
  4456	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through
  4457	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunderneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out
  4458	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind
  4459	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and
  4460	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier
  4461	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan real ones is, but they warn’t real because you could see where
  4462	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it
  4463	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas, underneath.
  4464	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4465	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and
  4466	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It
  4467	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,
  4468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a
  4469	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim’s Progress, about a
  4470	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman that left his family, it didn’t say why.  I read considerable in it
  4471	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was
  4472	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFriendship’s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn’t
  4473	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tread the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay’s Speeches, and another was Dr.
  4474	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGunn’s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body
  4475	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And
  4476	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged
  4477	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown in the middle and busted, like an old basket.
  4478	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4479	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,
  4480	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the
  4481	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDeclaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the
  4482	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdaughters which was dead made her own self when she was only
  4483	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see
  4484	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black
  4485	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in
  4486	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with
  4487	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and
  4488	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a
  4489	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand
  4490	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,
  4491	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.”
  4492	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t  Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight
  4493	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a
  4494	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird
  4495	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath
  4496	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”
  4497	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t  There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the
  4498	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in
  4499	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was
  4500	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath
  4501	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.”  These
  4502	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take
  4503	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the
  4504	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot
  4505	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done
  4506	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was
  4507	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thaving a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they
  4508	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and
  4509	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it
  4510	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman
  4511	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump
  4512	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with
  4513	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her
  4514	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up
  4515	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,
  4516	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died
  4517	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the
  4518	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung
  4519	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young
  4520	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so
  4521	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmany arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.
  4522	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4523	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste
  4524	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
  4525	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPresbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.
  4526	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name
  4527	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:
  4528	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4529	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D
  4530	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4531	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd did young Stephen sicken,    And did young Stephen die? And did the
  4532	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsad hearts thicken,    And did the mourners cry?
  4533	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4534	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNo; such was not the fate of    Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad
  4535	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thearts round him thickened,    ‘Twas not from sickness’ shots.
  4536	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4537	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNo whooping-cough did rack his frame,    Nor measles drear with spots;
  4538	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNot these impaired the sacred name    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.
  4539	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4540	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDespised love struck not with woe    That head of curly knots, Nor
  4541	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstomach troubles laid him low,    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.
  4542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4543	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tO no. Then list with tearful eye,    Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul
  4544	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdid from this cold world fly    By falling down a well.
  4545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey got him out and emptied him;    Alas it was too late; His spirit
  4547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas gone for to sport aloft    In the realms of the good and great.
  4548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4549	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
  4550	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by and by.  Buck
  4551	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid she could rattle off poetry like nothing.  She didn’t ever have to
  4552	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstop to think.  He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn’t
  4553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfind anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down
  4554	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother one, and go ahead. She warn’t particular; she could write about
  4555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.
  4556	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEvery time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on
  4557	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand with her “tribute” before he was cold.  She called them tributes.
  4558	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the
  4559	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tundertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and
  4560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person’s name, which was
  4561	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhistler.  She warn’t ever the same after that; she never complained,
  4562	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut she kinder pined away and did not live long.  Poor thing, many’s the
  4563	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get
  4564	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been
  4565	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taggravating me and I had soured on her a little.  I liked all that
  4566	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfamily, dead ones and all, and warn’t going to let anything come between
  4567	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was
  4568	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talive, and it didn’t seem right that there warn’t nobody to make some
  4569	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two
  4570	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself, but I couldn’t seem to make it go somehow.  They kept Emmeline’s
  4571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troom trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she
  4572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tliked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.
  4573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty
  4574	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there
  4575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmostly.
  4576	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on
  4578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines
  4579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.  There was a little
  4580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever
  4581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken”
  4582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t and play “The Battle of Prague” on it.  The walls of all the rooms was
  4583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was
  4584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhitewashed on the outside.
  4585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed
  4587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the
  4588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday, and it was a cool, comfortable place.  Nothing couldn’t be better.
  4589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t And warn’t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!
  4590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  4594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVIII.
  4595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCOL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all
  4597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and
  4598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas
  4599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy
  4600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more
  4601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and
  4602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it
  4603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and
  4604	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and
  4605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so
  4606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at
  4607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and
  4608	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and
  4609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head
  4610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;
  4611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He
  4612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn’t no
  4613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud.  He was
  4614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had
  4615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconfidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he
  4616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to
  4617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,
  4618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn’t ever have to
  4619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered
  4620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine
  4621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned
  4622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was
  4623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again for a week.
  4624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got
  4626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set down again
  4627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where
  4628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and
  4629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was mixed, and
  4630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and _they_
  4631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,
  4632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and
  4633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and
  4634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.
  4635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad
  4637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  They
  4638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and
  4639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twore broad Panama hats.
  4640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud
  4642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but
  4643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,
  4644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike her father.  She was beautiful.
  4645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She was
  4647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.
  4648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEach person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too.  My nigger
  4650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having anybody do
  4651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the time.
  4652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be
  4654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.
  4655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.
  4657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or
  4658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings
  4659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tround about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods
  4660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdaytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly
  4661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was a
  4662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandsome lot of quality, I tell you.
  4663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six
  4665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfamilies--mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They was as high-toned
  4666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.  The
  4667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was
  4668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a
  4669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their
  4670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfine horses.
  4671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse
  4673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming.  We was crossing the road.  Buck says:
  4674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick!  Jump for the woods!”
  4676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.  Pretty
  4678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his
  4679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his gun across his
  4680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young Harney Shepherdson.  I
  4681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard Buck’s gun go off at my ear, and Harney’s hat tumbled off from his
  4682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead.  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was
  4683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thid.  But we didn’t wait.  We started through the woods on a run.  The
  4684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods warn’t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,
  4685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away
  4686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn’t see.  We never
  4687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman’s eyes blazed a
  4688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute--‘twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed
  4689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown, and he says, kind of gentle:
  4690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn’t you step
  4692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the road, my boy?”
  4693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The Shepherdsons don’t, father.  They always take advantage.”
  4695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling
  4697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.  The two young
  4698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmen looked dark, but never said nothing.  Miss Sophia she turned pale,
  4699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut the color come back when she found the man warn’t hurt.
  4700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSoon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by
  4702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tourselves, I says:
  4703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”
  4705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I bet I did.”
  4707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did he do to you?”
  4709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Him?  He never done nothing to me.”
  4711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”
  4713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, nothing--only it’s on account of the feud.”
  4715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s a feud?”
  4717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, where was you raised?  Don’t you know what a feud is?”
  4719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never heard of it before--tell me about it.”
  4721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel with
  4723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother man, and kills him; then that other man’s brother kills _him_;
  4724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the
  4725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody’s killed off, and there ain’t
  4726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more feud.  But it’s kind of slow, and takes a long time.”
  4727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Has this one been going on long, Buck?”
  4729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I should _reckon_!  It started thirty year ago, or som’ers along
  4731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere.  There was trouble ‘bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle
  4732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the
  4733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course.  Anybody
  4734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould.”
  4735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?”
  4737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon maybe--I don’t know.”
  4739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, who done the shooting?  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?”
  4741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Laws, how do I know?  It was so long ago.”
  4743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t anybody know?”
  4745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they
  4747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t know now what the row was about in the first place.”
  4748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Has there been many killed, Buck?”
  4750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes; right smart chance of funerals.  But they don’t always kill.  Pa’s
  4752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot a few buckshot in him; but he don’t mind it ‘cuz he don’t weigh
  4753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch, anyway.  Bob’s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom’s been
  4754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurt once or twice.”
  4755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”
  4757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes; we got one and they got one.  ‘Bout three months ago my cousin
  4759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t’other side
  4760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the river, and didn’t have no weapon with him, which was blame’
  4761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind
  4762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after him with his gun in
  4763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and ‘stead of jumping
  4764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff and taking to the brush, Bud ‘lowed he could out-run him; so they
  4765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all
  4766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe time; so at last Bud seen it warn’t any use, so he stopped and faced
  4767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old
  4768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman he rode up and shot him down.  But he didn’t git much chance to
  4769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.”
  4770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”
  4772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon he _warn’t_ a coward.  Not by a blame’ sight.  There ain’t a
  4774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one.  And there ain’t no cowards
  4775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamongst the Grangerfords either.  Why, that old man kep’ up his end in a
  4776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come
  4777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout winner.  They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got
  4778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind a little woodpile, and kep’ his horse before him to stop the
  4779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around
  4780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.
  4781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the
  4782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGrangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of ‘em was dead, and
  4783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother died the next day.  No, sir; if a body’s out hunting for cowards
  4784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the don’t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz
  4785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey don’t breed any of that _kind_.”
  4786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
  4788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept
  4789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.  The
  4790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all about
  4791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was
  4792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such
  4793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
  4794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpreforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to me
  4795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.
  4796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their
  4798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.  Buck and
  4799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.  I went up
  4800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.  I found that sweet
  4801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took
  4802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,
  4803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and
  4804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she’d forgot her
  4805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTestament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,
  4806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say
  4807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the
  4808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troad, and there warn’t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,
  4809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor there warn’t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor
  4810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin summer-time because it’s cool.  If you notice, most folks don’t go to
  4811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchurch only when they’ve got to; but a hog is different.
  4812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSays I to myself, something’s up; it ain’t natural for a girl to be in
  4814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops a
  4815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle piece of paper with “HALF-PAST TWO” wrote on it with a pencil.  I
  4816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\transacked it, but couldn’t find anything else.  I couldn’t make anything
  4817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home
  4818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.  She
  4819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till
  4820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and
  4821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and
  4822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She was
  4823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it
  4824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I got
  4825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I
  4826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,
  4827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper
  4828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and
  4829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplay now.
  4830	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon
  4832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was out
  4833	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes
  4834	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-running, and says:
  4835	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4836	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mars Jawge, if you’ll come down into de swamp I’ll show you a whole
  4837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstack o’ water-moccasins.”
  4838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThinks I, that’s mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  He oughter
  4840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow a body don’t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for
  4841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem. What is he up to, anyway?  So I says:
  4842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right; trot ahead.”
  4844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4845	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded
  4846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat piece
  4847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,
  4848	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand he says:
  4849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah’s whah dey is.
  4851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’s seed ‘m befo’; I don’t k’yer to see ‘em no mo’.”
  4852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid
  4854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.  I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch
  4855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying
  4856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!
  4857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to
  4859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim to see me again, but it warn’t.  He nearly cried he was so glad, but
  4860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the warn’t surprised.  Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard
  4861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme yell every time, but dasn’t answer, because he didn’t want nobody to
  4862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.  Says he:
  4863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I got hurt a little, en couldn’t swim fas’, so I wuz a considable ways

  4948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took up the river road as hard as I could put.  By and by I begin to
  4950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear guns a good ways off.  When I come in sight of the log store and
  4951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees
  4952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the
  4953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.  There was a
  4954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I
  4955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.
  4956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
  4958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at
  4959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the
  4960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteamboat landing; but they couldn’t come it.  Every time one of them
  4961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.  The
  4962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch
  4963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth ways.
  4964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.  They started
  4966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady
  4967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle.  All
  4968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started
  4969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the
  4970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trun.  They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.
  4971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after
  4972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.  They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys had
  4973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,
  4974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.
  4975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about
  4976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnineteen years old.
  4977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.  As soon as they was
  4979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of sight I sung out to Buck and told him.  He didn’t know what
  4980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.  He was awful
  4981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsurprised.  He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the
  4982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmen come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or
  4983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother--wouldn’t be gone long.  I wished I was out of that tree, but I
  4984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdasn’t come down.  Buck begun to cry and rip, and ‘lowed that him and
  4985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this
  4986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday yet.  He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two
  4987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor three of the enemy.  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in
  4988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tambush.  Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their
  4989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trelations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them.  I asked him what
  4990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.  He said they’d got across
  4991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river and was safe.  I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take
  4992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton because he didn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I
  4993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thain’t ever heard anything like it.
  4994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had
  4996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
  4997	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorses!  The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they
  4998	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tswum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and
  4999	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsinging out, “Kill them, kill them!”  It made me so sick I most fell out
  5000	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the tree.  I ain’t a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would make
  5001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme sick again if I was to do that.  I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore
  5002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat night to see such things.  I ain’t ever going to get shut of
  5003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem--lots of times I dream about them.
  5004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
  5006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little
  5007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the
  5008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrouble was still a-going on.  I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my
  5009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I
  5010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss
  5011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and
  5012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
  5013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess
  5014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t ever happened.
  5015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a
  5017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpiece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and
  5018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,
  5019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand got away as quick as I could.  I cried a little when I was covering
  5020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup Buck’s face, for he was mighty good to me.
  5021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was just dark now.  I never went near the house, but struck through
  5023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe woods and made for the swamp.  Jim warn’t on his island, so I
  5024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,
  5025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tred-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.  The raft was
  5026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone!  My souls, but I was scared!  I couldn’t get my breath for most
  5027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta minute. Then I raised a yell.  A voice not twenty-five foot from me
  5028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  5029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good lan’! is dat you, honey?  Doan’ make no noise.”
  5031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was Jim’s voice--nothing ever sounded so good before.  I run along the
  5033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was
  5034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso glad to see me.  He says:
  5035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Laws bless you, chile, I ‘uz right down sho’ you’s dead agin.  Jack’s
  5037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen heah; he say he reck’n you’s ben shot, kase you didn’ come home no

  5040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead.  Lawsy, I’s mighty
  5041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tglad to git you back again, honey.”
  5042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  5044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right--that’s mighty good; they won’t find me, and they’ll think
  5046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ve been killed, and floated down the river--there’s something up there
  5047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ‘ll help them think so--so don’t you lose no time, Jim, but just
  5048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.”
  5049	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5050	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in
  5051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe middle of the Mississippi.  Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
  5052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudged that we was free and safe once more.  I hadn’t had a bite to eat
  5053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsince yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,
  5054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand pork and cabbage and greens--there ain’t nothing in the world so good
  5055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen it’s cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
  5056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood time.  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was
  5057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim to get away from the swamp.  We said there warn’t no home like a
  5058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft, after all.  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a
  5059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft don’t.  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.

  5064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XIX.
  5065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,
  5067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put
  5068	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile
  5069	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as
  5070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always
  5071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and
  5072	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twillows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next
  5073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool
  5074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee
  5075	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly
  5076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs
  5077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the
  5078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t’other side; you
  5079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more
  5080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and
  5081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots
  5082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and
  5083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or
  5084	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and
  5085	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the
  5086	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstreak that there’s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it
  5087	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off
  5088	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a
  5089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlog-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t’other side of
  5090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can
  5091	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrow a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and
  5092	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell
  5093	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,
  5094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause they’ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they
  5095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo get pretty rank; and next you’ve got the full day, and everything
  5096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!
  5097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tA little smoke couldn’t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off
  5099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch
  5100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by
  5101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and
  5102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmaybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the
  5103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother side you couldn’t tell nothing about her only whether she was
  5104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn’t be
  5105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next
  5106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it
  5107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchopping, because they’re most always doing it on a raft; you’d see the
  5108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taxe flash and come down--you don’t hear nothing; you see that axe go
  5109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup again, and by the time it’s above the man’s head then you hear the
  5110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_k’chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we
  5111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once
  5112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating
  5113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttin pans so the steamboats wouldn’t run over them.  A scow or a
  5114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and
  5115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughing--heard them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it made
  5116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.
  5117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:
  5118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern the dern fog.’”
  5120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the
  5122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted
  5123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and
  5124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,
  5125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck’s folks made
  5126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t go much on
  5127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes, nohow.
  5128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest
  5130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe
  5131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water
  5132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe
  5133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.
  5134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt’s lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled
  5135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and
  5136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdiscuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he
  5137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tallowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would
  5138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave took too long to _make_ so many.  Jim said the moon could a _laid_
  5139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn’t say nothing
  5140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst it, because I’ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it
  5141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them
  5142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstreak down.  Jim allowed they’d got spoiled and was hove out of the
  5143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnest.
  5144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the
  5146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out
  5147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful
  5148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and
  5149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her
  5150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the
  5151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft a bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’t
  5152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell how long, except maybe frogs or something.
  5153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5154	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or
  5155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.
  5156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant
  5157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmorning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.
  5158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to
  5160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile
  5161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn’t get some
  5162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tberries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed
  5163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as
  5164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was
  5165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim.  I was about to dig out
  5166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung
  5167	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn’t been doing
  5168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs
  5169	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-coming.  They wanted to jump right in, but I says:
  5170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you do it.  I don’t hear the dogs and horses yet; you’ve got time
  5172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you
  5173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake to the water and wade down to me and get in--that’ll throw the dogs
  5174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff the scent.”
  5175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,
  5177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,
  5178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn’t
  5179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got
  5180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther and further away all the time, we couldn’t hardly hear them at
  5181	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the
  5182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid
  5183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the cottonwoods and was safe.
  5184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head
  5186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand very gray whiskers.  He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and
  5187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed
  5188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one.  He had
  5189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tan old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
  5190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.
  5191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.  After
  5193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out
  5194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas that these chaps didn’t know one another.
  5195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What got you into trouble?” says the baldhead to t’other chap.
  5197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’d been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--and
  5199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but I
  5200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act
  5201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and
  5202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off.  So
  5203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_
  5204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou. That’s the whole yarn--what’s yourn?
  5205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5206	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’d ben a-running’ a little temperance revival thar ‘bout a week,

  5211	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot around last night that I had a way of puttin’ in my time with a
  5212	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprivate jug on the sly.  A nigger rousted me out this mornin’, and told
  5213	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme the people was getherin’ on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and
  5214	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d be along pretty soon and give me ‘bout half an hour’s start,
  5215	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then run me down if they could; and if they got me they’d tar
  5216	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand feather me and ride me on a rail, sure.  I didn’t wait for no
  5217	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast--I warn’t hungry.”
  5218	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5219	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Old man,” said the young one, “I reckon we might double-team it
  5220	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether; what do you think?”
  5221	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5222	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I ain’t undisposed.  What’s your line--mainly?”

  5235	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5236	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh
  5237	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
  5238	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Alas!”
  5240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What ‘re you alassin’ about?” says the bald-head.

  5245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a rag.
  5246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dern your skin, ain’t the company good enough for you?” says the

  5250	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, it _is_ good enough for me; it’s as good as I deserve; for who

  5255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can’t take

  5275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.

  5278	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.  My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled

  5288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but

  5294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t or “Your Lordship”--and he wouldn’t mind it if we called him plain
  5295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and
  5296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for

  5298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood
  5300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some o’ dis or

  5303	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5304	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn’t have much to say, and
  5305	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on
  5306	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround that duke.  He seemed to have something on his mind.  So, along
  5307	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the afternoon, he says:
  5308	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5309	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation sorry for you, but you
  5310	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t the only person that’s had troubles like that.”
  5311	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5312	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No?”
  5313	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5314	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No you ain’t.  You ain’t the only person that’s ben snaked down
  5315	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrongfully out’n a high place.”
  5316	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5317	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Alas!”
  5318	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5319	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, you ain’t the only person that’s had a secret of his birth.”  And,
  5320	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby jings, _he_ begins to cry.
  5321	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5322	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold!  What do you mean?”
  5323	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5324	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of sobbing.
  5325	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5326	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“To the bitter death!”  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,
  5327	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says, “That secret of your being:  speak!”
  5328	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5329	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”
  5330	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5331	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke says:
  5332	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5333	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You are what?”
  5334	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5335	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin’ at this very moment
  5336	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the
  5337	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSixteen and Marry Antonette.”
  5338	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5339	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You!  At your age!  No!  You mean you’re the late Charlemagne; you must
  5340	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.”
  5341	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5342	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung
  5343	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese gray hairs and this premature balditude.  Yes, gentlemen, you
  5344	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled,
  5345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.”
  5346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn’t know hardly what to
  5348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we’d got him with us, too.
  5349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort
  5350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_him_. But he said it warn’t no use, nothing but to be dead and done
  5351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel
  5352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teasier and better for a while if people treated him according to his
  5353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him
  5354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn’t set down
  5355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,
  5356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand doing this and that and t’other for him, and standing up till he
  5357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so he
  5358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, and
  5359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,
  5360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke’s
  5361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good
  5362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace
  5363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the
  5364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking says:
  5365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer
  5367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your bein’ sour?  It ‘ll only
  5368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake things oncomfortable.  It ain’t my fault I warn’t born a duke,
  5369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit ain’t your fault you warn’t born a king--so what’s the use to worry?
  5370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Make the best o’ things the way you find ‘em, says I--that’s my motto.
  5371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here--plenty grub and an easy
  5372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlife--come, give us your hand, duke, and le’s all be friends.”
  5373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  It took
  5375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because
  5376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the
  5377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody
  5378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.
  5379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt didn’t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn’t no
  5381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  But I
  5382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it’s the best way;
  5383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen you don’t have no quarrels, and don’t get into no trouble.  If they
  5384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn’t no objections, ‘long as
  5385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would keep peace in the family; and it warn’t no use to tell Jim, so
  5386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t tell him.  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt
  5387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
  5388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave their own way.

  5393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XX.
  5394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we
  5396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcovered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of
  5397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trunning--was Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:
  5398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?”
  5400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNo, they allowed he wouldn’t.  I had to account for things some way, so
  5402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  5403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and
  5405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he ‘lowed
  5406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who’s got a little
  5407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was
  5408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty poor, and had some debts; so when he’d squared up there warn’t
  5409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn’t
  5410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.
  5411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched
  5412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis piece of a raft; so we reckoned we’d go down to Orleans on it.
  5413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Pa’s luck didn’t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of
  5414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;
  5415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four
  5416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyears old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or
  5417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in
  5418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tskiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was
  5419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta runaway nigger.  We don’t run daytimes no more now; nights they don’t
  5420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbother us.”
  5421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says:
  5423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
  5425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to.  I’ll think the thing over--I’ll invent a plan that’ll fix it.
  5426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe’ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don’t want to go by
  5427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat town yonder in daylight--it mightn’t be healthy.”
  5428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTowards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat
  5430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was
  5431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see
  5432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see
  5433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim’s,
  5434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhich was a corn-shuck tick; there’s always cobs around about in a shuck
  5435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry
  5436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it
  5437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmakes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would
  5438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn’t.  He says:
  5439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that
  5441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta corn-shuck bed warn’t just fitten for me to sleep on.  Your Grace ‘ll
  5442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake the shuck bed yourself.”
  5443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was
  5445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when
  5446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke says:
  5447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of
  5449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I
  5450	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsubmit; ‘tis my fate.  I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear
  5451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
  5452	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5453	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to stand
  5454	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we
  5455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch of
  5456	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half
  5457	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we
  5458	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clock it come on to rain
  5459	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us
  5460	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke
  5461	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch
  5462	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow till twelve, but I wouldn’t a turned in anyway if I’d had a bed,
  5463	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause a body don’t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not
  5464	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every
  5465	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecond or two there’d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half
  5466	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta mile around, and you’d see the islands looking dusty through the rain,
  5467	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!
  5468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling
  5469	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and
  5470	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,
  5471	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut I hadn’t any clothes on, and didn’t mind.  We didn’t have no trouble
  5472	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant
  5473	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or
  5474	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat and miss them.
  5475	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5476	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,
  5477	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always
  5478	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the king
  5479	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn’t no show for
  5480	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme; so I laid outside--I didn’t mind the rain, because it was warm, and
  5481	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe waves warn’t running so high now.  About two they come up again,
  5482	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthough, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because
  5483	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was
  5484	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a
  5485	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tregular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim a-laughing.
  5486	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.
  5487	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5488	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by
  5489	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed
  5490	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the
  5491	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday.
  5492	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5493	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him
  5494	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  Then they got
  5495	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttired of it, and allowed they would “lay out a campaign,” as they called
  5496	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of
  5497	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle printed bills and read them out loud.  One bill said, “The
  5498	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcelebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” would “lecture on the
  5499	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tScience of Phrenology” at such and such a place, on the blank day of
  5500	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblank, at ten cents admission, and “furnish charts of character at
  5501	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwenty-five cents apiece.”  The duke said that was _him_.  In another
  5502	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbill he was the “world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the
  5503	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYounger, of Drury Lane, London.”  In other bills he had a lot of other
  5504	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnames and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with
  5505	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta “divining-rod,” “dissipating witch spells,” and so on.  By and by he
  5506	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  5507	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5508	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod the boards,
  5509	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tRoyalty?”
  5510	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5511	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” says the king.
  5512	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5513	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You shall, then, before you’re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,” says
  5514	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke.  “The first good town we come to we’ll hire a hall and do the
  5515	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.
  5516	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHow does that strike you?”
  5517	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5518	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you
  5519	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee, I don’t know nothing about play-actin’, and hain’t ever seen much
  5520	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it.  I was too small when pap used to have ‘em at the palace.  Do you
  5521	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon you can learn me?”
  5522	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5523	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Easy!”
  5524	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5525	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right.  I’m jist a-freezn’ for something fresh, anyway.  Le’s
  5526	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcommence right away.”
  5527	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5528	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and
  5529	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.
  5530	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5531	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But if Juliet’s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white
  5532	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhiskers is goin’ to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.”
  5533	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5534	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, don’t you worry; these country jakes won’t ever think of that.
  5535	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBesides, you know, you’ll be in costume, and that makes all the
  5536	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifference in the world; Juliet’s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight
  5537	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore she goes to bed, and she’s got on her night-gown and her ruffled
  5538	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.”
  5539	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5540	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was
  5541	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeedyevil armor for Richard III. and t’other chap, and a long white
  5542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king was
  5543	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the
  5544	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same
  5545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the
  5546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking and told him to get his part by heart.
  5547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and
  5549	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
  5550	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would
  5551	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,
  5552	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo, and see if he couldn’t strike something.  We was out of coffee, so
  5553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.
  5554	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got there there warn’t nobody stirring; streets empty, and
  5556	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunning
  5557	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn’t too young or
  5558	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the
  5559	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he’d go and work that
  5560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcamp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.
  5561	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5562	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;
  5563	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and
  5564	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprinters all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,
  5565	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of
  5566	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed
  5567	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for
  5568	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe camp-meeting.
  5569	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5570	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most
  5571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there from
  5572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched
  5573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep
  5574	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with
  5575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbranches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of
  5576	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatermelons and green corn and such-like truck.
  5577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was
  5579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside
  5580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into
  5581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor legs. They didn’t have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms
  5582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;
  5583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the
  5584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and
  5585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome of the children didn’t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen
  5586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks
  5587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas courting on the sly.
  5588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined
  5590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,
  5591	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then
  5592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up
  5593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some
  5594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to
  5595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpreach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of
  5596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front
  5597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his
  5598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twords out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up
  5599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and
  5600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat, shouting, “It’s the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon
  5601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit and live!”  And people would shout out, “Glory!--A-a-_men_!”  And so
  5602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:
  5603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5604	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, come to the mourners’ bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,
  5605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,
  5606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that’s worn and
  5607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite
  5608	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse
  5609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!”
  5610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t (_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)
  5611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so on.  You couldn’t make out what the preacher said any more, on
  5613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccount of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up everywheres in the
  5614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners’
  5615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the
  5616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and
  5617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.
  5618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him
  5620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and
  5621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  He
  5622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the
  5623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIndian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in
  5624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to
  5625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoodness he’d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat
  5626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twithout a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that
  5627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for
  5628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start
  5629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest
  5630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could
  5631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews
  5632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there
  5633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twithout money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced
  5634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta pirate he would say to him, “Don’t you thank me, don’t you give me no
  5635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcredit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,
  5636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnatural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher
  5637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”
  5638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.  Then somebody
  5640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!”  Well,
  5641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let _him_
  5642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpass the hat around!”  Then everybody said it, the preacher too.
  5643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,
  5645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being
  5646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the
  5647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would
  5648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he
  5649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or
  5650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsix times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to
  5651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlive in their houses, and said they’d think it was an honor; but he said
  5652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn’t do no good, and
  5653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbesides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to
  5654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twork on the pirates.
  5655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had
  5657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcollected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.  And then he had
  5658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a
  5659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twagon when he was starting home through the woods.  The king said,
  5660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake it all around, it laid over any day he’d ever put in in the
  5661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmissionarying line.  He said it warn’t no use talking, heathens don’t
  5662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.
  5663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke was thinking _he’d_ been doing pretty well till the king come
  5665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto show up, but after that he didn’t think so so much.  He had set
  5666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that
  5667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprinting-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.  And he
  5668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad got in ten dollars’ worth of advertisements for the paper, which he
  5669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so
  5670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took
  5671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them
  5672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as
  5673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tusual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the
  5674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprice as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.
  5675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of
  5676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,
  5677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”--and he left that all set
  5678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and ready to print in the paper, and didn’t charge nothing for it.
  5679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he’d done a pretty
  5680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsquare day’s work for it.
  5681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he showed us another little job he’d printed and hadn’t charged
  5683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with
  5684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it.  The
  5685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot.  It said
  5686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the run away from St. Jacques’ plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,
  5687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send
  5688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim back he could have the reward and expenses.
  5689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the daytime if we
  5691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to.  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot
  5692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
  5693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaptured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,
  5694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down
  5695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto get the reward.  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,
  5696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut it wouldn’t go well with the story of us being so poor.  Too much
  5697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike jewelry.  Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,
  5698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas we say on the boards.”
  5699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn’t be no trouble
  5701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout running daytimes.  We judged we could make miles enough that night
  5702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke’s work in
  5703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could
  5704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboom right along if we wanted to.
  5705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten
  5707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn’t
  5708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.
  5709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:
  5711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, does you reck’n we gwyne to run acrost any mo’ kings on dis
  5713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrip?”
  5714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” I says, “I reckon not.”
  5716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says he, “dat’s all right, den.  I doan’ mine one er two kings,
  5718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut dat’s enough.  Dis one’s powerful drunk, en de duke ain’ much
  5719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter.”
  5720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear
  5722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and
  5723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad so much trouble, he’d forgot it.

  5729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn’t tie up.  The
  5731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after
  5732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good
  5733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,
  5734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs
  5735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went
  5736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.  When he had got it pretty
  5737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood him and the duke begun to practice it together.  The duke had to
  5738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlearn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him
  5739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done
  5740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn’t bellow out _Romeo_!
  5741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,
  5742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet’s a dear sweet mere child of
  5743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta girl, you know, and she doesn’t bray like a jackass.”
  5744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out
  5746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called
  5747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around
  5748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe raft was grand to see.  But by and by the king tripped and fell
  5749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toverboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all
  5750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkinds of adventures they’d had in other times along the river.
  5751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  5754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Capet, we’ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so
  5755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI guess we’ll add a little more to it.  We want a little something to
  5756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanswer encores with, anyway.”
  5757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s onkores, Bilgewater?”
  5759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke told him, and then says:
  5761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor’s hornpipe; and
  5763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou--well, let me see--oh, I’ve got it--you can do Hamlet’s soliloquy.”
  5764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hamlet’s which?”
  5766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hamlet’s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.
  5768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAh, it’s sublime, sublime!  Always fetches the house.  I haven’t got
  5769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit in the book--I’ve only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out
  5770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom memory.  I’ll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call
  5771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit back from recollection’s vaults.”
  5772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible
  5774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would
  5775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsqueeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next
  5776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would sigh, and next he’d let on to drop a tear.  It was beautiful
  5777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see him. By and by he got it.  He told us to give attention.  Then
  5778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his
  5779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tarms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;
  5780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,
  5781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his
  5782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.
  5783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t This is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it
  5784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the king:
  5785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTo be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of
  5787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come
  5788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the
  5789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinnocent sleep, Great nature’s second course, And makes us rather sling
  5790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.
  5791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere’s the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I
  5792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The
  5793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, The law’s delay, and the
  5794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the
  5795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But
  5796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,
  5797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBreathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of
  5798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresolution, like the poor cat i’ the adage, Is sicklied o’er with care.
  5799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd all the clouds that lowered o’er our housetops, With this
  5800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tregard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. ‘Tis a
  5801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope
  5802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go!
  5803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he
  5805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when
  5806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he
  5807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.
  5808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and
  5810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a
  5811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost uncommon lively place, for there warn’t nothing but sword-fighting
  5812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning,
  5813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight
  5814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about
  5815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was
  5816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took
  5817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that
  5818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace for our show.
  5819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that
  5821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in
  5822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave
  5823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he
  5824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They

  5875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all
  5877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted; they
  5878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of
  5879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little
  5880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgardens around them, but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything in
  5881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up
  5882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out
  5883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on
  5884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that
  5885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fences
  5886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in
  5887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tClumbus’s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and
  5888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople driving them out.
  5889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll the stores was along one street.  They had white domestic awnings in
  5891	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfront, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.
  5892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting
  5893	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and
  5894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery
  5895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,
  5896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,
  5897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and
  5898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused considerable many cuss words.  There was as many as one loafer
  5899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands
  5900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw
  5901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof tobacco or scratch.  What a body was hearing amongst them all the
  5902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime was:
  5903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gimme a chaw ‘v tobacker, Hank.”
  5905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left.  Ask Bill.”
  5907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got
  5909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnone. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a
  5910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchaw of tobacco of their own.  They get all their chawing by borrowing;
  5911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’ me a chaw, Jack, I jist this
  5912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”--which is a lie pretty
  5913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch everytime; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain’t no
  5914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstranger, so he says:
  5915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_You_ give him a chaw, did you?  So did your sister’s cat’s
  5917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrandmother. You pay me back the chaws you’ve awready borry’d off’n me,
  5918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLafe Buckner, then I’ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won’t charge
  5919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou no back intrust, nuther.”
  5920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.”
  5922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, you did--‘bout six chaws.  You borry’d store tobacker and paid back
  5924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger-head.”
  5925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the
  5927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnatural leaf twisted.  When they borrow a chaw they don’t generly cut it
  5928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with
  5929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in
  5930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it
  5931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen it’s handed back, and says, sarcastic:
  5932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.”
  5934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5935	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing else _but_
  5936	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,
  5937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand two or three inches deep in _all_ the places.  The hogs loafed and
  5938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrunted around everywheres.  You’d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs
  5939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,
  5940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere folks had to walk around her, and she’d stretch out and shut her
  5941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as
  5942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thappy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you’d hear a loafer
  5943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsing out, “Hi!  _so_ boy! sick him, Tige!” and away the sow would go,
  5944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsquealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and
  5945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the
  5946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun
  5947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand look grateful for the noise.  Then they’d settle back again till
  5948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was a dog fight.  There couldn’t anything wake them up all over,
  5949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be
  5950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tputting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a
  5951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.
  5952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,
  5954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people
  5955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad moved out of them.  The bank was caved away under one corner of some
  5956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tothers, and that corner was hanging over.  People lived in them yet, but
  5957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house
  5958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaves in at a time.  Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep
  5959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the
  5960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,
  5961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand back, and back, because the river’s always gnawing at it.
  5962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the
  5964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.
  5965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them
  5966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the wagons.  There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I
  5967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseen three fights.  By and by somebody sings out:
  5968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthly
  5970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk; here he comes, boys!”
  5971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out
  5973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof Boggs.  One of them says:
  5974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time.  If he’d a-chawed up all
  5976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe men he’s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he’d have
  5977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable ruputation now.”
  5978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother one says, “I wisht old Boggs ‘d threaten me, ‘cuz then I’d know
  5980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI warn’t gwyne to die for a thousan’ year.”
  5981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an
  5983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun, and singing out:
  5984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cler the track, thar.  I’m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is

  5987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year
  5989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told, and had a very red face.  Everybody yelled at him and laughed at
  5990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he’d attend to them and
  5991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn’t wait now because
  5992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, “Meat
  5993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst, and spoon vittles to top off on.”
  5994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe see me, and rode up and says:
  5996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5997	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Whar’d you come f’m, boy?  You prepared to die?”
  5998	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5999	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he rode on.  I was scared, but a man says:
  6000	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He don’t mean nothing; he’s always a-carryin’ on like that when he’s
  6002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk.  He’s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,
  6003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk nor sober.”
  6004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down
  6006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:
  6007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you’ve swindled.
  6009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou’re the houn’ I’m after, and I’m a-gwyne to have you, too!”
  6010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue
  6012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and
  6013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing on.  By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a
  6014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and
  6015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,
  6016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty ca’m and slow--he says:
  6017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m tired of this, but I’ll endure it till one o’clock.  Till one
  6019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’clock, mind--no longer.  If you open your mouth against me only once
  6020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter that time you can’t travel so far but I will find you.”
  6021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he turns and goes in.  The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody
  6023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstirred, and there warn’t no more laughing.  Boggs rode off
  6024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;
  6025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping
  6026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,
  6027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut he wouldn’t; they told him it would be one o’clock in about fifteen
  6028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn’t
  6029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down
  6030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down
  6031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get
  6032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they
  6033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould lock him up and get him sober; but it warn’t no use--up the street
  6034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and by
  6035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomebody says:
  6036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he’ll listen
  6038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto her.  If anybody can persuade him, she can.”
  6039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo somebody started on a run.  I walked down street a ways and stopped.
  6041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his
  6042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorse.  He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with
  6043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.
  6044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn’t hanging back any, but was
  6045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:
  6046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Boggs!”
  6048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6049	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel
  6050	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a
  6051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with
  6052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second I see a young
  6053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgirl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turned
  6054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tround to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men
  6055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to
  6056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,
  6057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“O Lord, don’t shoot!”  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,
  6058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards
  6059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That young
  6060	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgirl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her
  6061	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfather, crying, and saying, “Oh, he’s killed him, he’s killed him!”  The
  6062	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with
  6063	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to
  6064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshove them back and shouting, “Back, back! give him air, give him air!”
  6065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tColonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned
  6067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround on his heels and walked off.
  6068	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6069	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just
  6070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good
  6071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  They
  6072	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened
  6073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt
  6074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about a
  6075	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his
  6076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that
  6077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from
  6078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was about sixteen, and
  6079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.
  6080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and
  6082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people
  6083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat had the places wouldn’t give them up, and folks behind them was
  6084	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying all the time, “Say, now, you’ve looked enough, you fellows;
  6085	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘tain’t right and ‘tain’t fair for you to stay thar all the time, and
  6086	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as
  6087	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou.”
  6088	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe
  6090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and everybody was
  6091	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texcited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,
  6092	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,
  6093	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstretching their necks and listening.  One long, lanky man, with long
  6094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a
  6095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs
  6096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from
  6097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone place to t’other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their
  6098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their
  6099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with
  6100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had
  6101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung
  6102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, “Boggs!” and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says
  6103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bang!” staggered backwards, says “Bang!” again, and fell down flat on
  6104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;
  6105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid it was just exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as a
  6106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdozen people got out their bottles and treated him.
  6107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.  In about a
  6109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and
  6110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.
  6111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXII.
  6116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHEY swarmed up towards Sherburn’s house, a-whooping and raging like
  6118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tInjuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped
  6119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of the
  6120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along
  6121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe road was full of women’s heads, and there was nigger boys in every
  6122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the
  6123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
  6124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treach.  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared
  6125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost to death.
  6126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey swarmed up in front of Sherburn’s palings as thick as they could
  6128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjam together, and you couldn’t hear yourself think for the noise.  It
  6129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out “Tear down the fence! tear
  6130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the fence!”  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and
  6131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to
  6132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troll in like a wave.
  6133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJust then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,
  6135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly
  6136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tca’m and deliberate, not saying a word.  The racket stopped, and the
  6137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twave sucked back.
  6138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down.  The
  6140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.  Sherburn run his eye slow
  6141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
  6142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout-gaze him, but they couldn’t; they dropped their eyes and looked
  6143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant
  6144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread
  6145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s got sand in it.
  6146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he says, slow and scornful:
  6148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The idea of _you_ lynching anybody!  It’s amusing.  The idea of you
  6150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_!  Because you’re brave
  6151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along
  6152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a
  6153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_man_?  Why, a _man’s_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as
  6154	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong as it’s daytime and you’re not behind him.
  6155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do I know you?  I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the
  6157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSouth, and I’ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around.
  6158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe average man’s a coward.  In the North he lets anybody walk over him
  6159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.
  6160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men
  6161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the daytime, and robbed the lot.  Your newspapers call you a
  6162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrave people so much that you think you are braver than any other
  6163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople--whereas you’re just _as_ brave, and no braver.  Why don’t your
  6164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjuries hang murderers?  Because they’re afraid the man’s friends will
  6165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoot them in the back, in the dark--and it’s just what they _would_ do.
  6166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6167	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a
  6168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.  Your mistake
  6169	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis, that you didn’t bring a man with you; that’s one mistake, and the
  6170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch your masks.  You
  6171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn’t had him
  6172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto start you, you’d a taken it out in blowing.
  6173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You didn’t want to come.  The average man don’t like trouble and
  6175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdanger. _You_ don’t like trouble and danger.  But if only _half_ a
  6176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts ‘Lynch him! lynch him!’ you’re
  6177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafraid to back down--afraid you’ll be found out to be what you
  6178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tare--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that
  6179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf-a-man’s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big
  6180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings you’re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s
  6181	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat an army is--a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in
  6182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from their
  6183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tofficers.  But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_
  6184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpitifulness.  Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and
  6185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo home and crawl in a hole.  If any real lynching’s going to be done it
  6186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they’ll
  6187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along.  Now _leave_--and take your
  6188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf-a-man with you”--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking
  6189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit when he says this.
  6190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing
  6192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking
  6193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttolerable cheap.  I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn’t want to.
  6194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
  6196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent by, and then dived in under the tent.  I had my twenty-dollar gold
  6197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpiece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because
  6198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere ain’t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from
  6199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thome and amongst strangers that way.  You can’t be too careful.  I ain’t
  6200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\topposed to spending money on circuses when there ain’t no other way, but
  6201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere ain’t no use in _wasting_ it on them.
  6202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a real bully circus.  It was the splendidest sight that ever was
  6204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side
  6205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes
  6206	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and
  6207	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a
  6208	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang
  6209	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of
  6210	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;
  6211	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got up
  6212	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and
  6213	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgraceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their
  6214	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and
  6215	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery lady’s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,
  6216	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand she looking like the most loveliest parasol.
  6217	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6218	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one
  6219	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and
  6220	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking
  6221	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this whip and shouting “Hi!--hi!” and the clown cracking jokes behind
  6222	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her
  6223	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how
  6224	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe horses did lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after the
  6225	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I
  6226	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and
  6227	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent just about wild.
  6228	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6229	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and
  6230	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.  The
  6231	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tringmaster couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick
  6232	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever
  6233	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I
  6234	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t noway understand. Why, I couldn’t a thought of them in a year.
  6235	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to
  6236	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They argued
  6237	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show
  6238	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make
  6239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that
  6240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the
  6241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbenches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him
  6242	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout!” and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster
  6243	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn’t be no
  6244	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdisturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn’t make no more
  6245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.
  6246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute
  6247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,
  6248	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the
  6249	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every
  6250	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing
  6251	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men
  6252	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,
  6253	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tround and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging
  6254	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,
  6255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then t’other one on t’other side, and the people just crazy.  It
  6256	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.
  6257	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,
  6258	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and
  6259	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire
  6260	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable
  6261	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas if he warn’t ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his
  6262	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up
  6263	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he
  6264	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you
  6265	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly
  6266	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to
  6267	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and
  6268	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tastonishment.
  6269	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6270	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the
  6271	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.  Why, it was one of his own
  6272	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmen!  He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on
  6273	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn’t
  6274	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta been in that ringmaster’s place, not for a thousand dollars.  I don’t
  6275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I
  6276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and
  6277	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.
  6278	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn’t only about twelve
  6280	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople there--just enough to pay expenses.  And they laughed all the
  6281	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before
  6282	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe show was over, but one boy which was asleep.  So the duke said these
  6283	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tArkansaw lunkheads couldn’t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted
  6284	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he
  6285	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned.  He said he could size their style.  So next morning he got
  6286	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off
  6287	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  The bills said:
  6288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6290	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6291	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6292	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXIII.
  6293	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and
  6295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house
  6296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas jam full of men in no time.  When the place couldn’t hold no more,
  6297	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on
  6298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,
  6299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one
  6300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about
  6301	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEdmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;
  6302	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand at last when he’d got everybody’s expectations up high enough, he
  6303	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing
  6304	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,
  6305	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a
  6306	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trainbow.  And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,
  6307	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and
  6308	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they
  6309	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done
  6310	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it
  6311	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.
  6312	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6313	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says
  6314	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of
  6315	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it
  6316	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has
  6317	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsucceeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply
  6318	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tobleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come
  6319	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see it.
  6320	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6321	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTwenty people sings out:
  6322	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6323	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What, is it over?  Is that _all_?”
  6324	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6325	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says yes.  Then there was a fine time.  Everybody sings
  6326	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, “Sold!” and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them
  6327	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttragedians.  But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:
  6328	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6329	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on!  Just a word, gentlemen.”  They stopped to listen.  “We are
  6330	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsold--mighty badly sold.  But we don’t want to be the laughing stock of
  6331	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long
  6332	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas we live.  _No_.  What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk
  6333	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town!  Then we’ll all be in the
  6334	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame boat.  Ain’t that sensible?” (“You bet it is!--the jedge is right!”
  6335	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t everybody sings out.) “All right, then--not a word about any sell.  Go
  6336	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.”
  6337	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6338	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext day you couldn’t hear nothing around that town but how splendid
  6339	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat show was.  House was jammed again that night, and we sold this
  6340	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrowd the same way.  When me and the king and the duke got home to the
  6341	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim
  6342	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and
  6343	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.
  6344	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe third night the house was crammed again--and they warn’t new-comers
  6346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis time, but people that was at the show the other two nights.  I
  6347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had
  6348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see it
  6349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.  I smelt sickly eggs
  6350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the
  6351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsigns of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four
  6352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof them went in.  I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various
  6353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me; I couldn’t stand it.  Well, when the place couldn’t hold no more
  6354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door
  6355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after
  6356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:
  6357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the
  6359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft like the dickens was after you!”
  6360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done it, and he done the same.  We struck the raft at the same time,
  6362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and
  6363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a
  6364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tword. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the
  6365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taudience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under
  6366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wigwam, and says:
  6367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, how’d the old thing pan out this time, duke?”  He hadn’t been
  6369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup-town at all.
  6370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.
  6372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly
  6373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughed their bones loose over the way they’d served them people.  The
  6374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke says:
  6375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Greenhorns, flatheads!  I knew the first house would keep mum and let
  6377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they’d lay for us the
  6378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthird night, and consider it was _their_ turn now.  Well, it _is_ their
  6379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturn, and I’d give something to know how much they’d take for it.  I
  6380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_would_ just like to know how they’re putting in their opportunity.
  6381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty
  6382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprovisions.”
  6383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that
  6385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree nights.  I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that
  6386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore.  By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:
  6387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t it s’prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?”
  6389	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” I says, “it don’t.”
  6391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why don’t it, Huck?”
  6393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it don’t, because it’s in the breed.  I reckon they’re all
  6395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talike.”
  6396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But, Huck, dese kings o’ ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat’s jist what
  6398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdey is; dey’s reglar rapscallions.”
  6399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s what I’m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as
  6401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfur as I can make out.”
  6402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is dat so?”
  6404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You read about them once--you’ll see.  Look at Henry the Eight; this ‘n
  6406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘s a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_.  And look at Charles Second,
  6407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward
  6408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSecond, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon
  6409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.  My,
  6410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He _was_ a
  6411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head
  6412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnext morning.  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
  6413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tordering up eggs.  ‘Fetch up Nell Gwynn,’ he says.  They fetch her up.
  6414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext morning, ‘Chop off her head!’  And they chop it off.  ‘Fetch up
  6415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJane Shore,’ he says; and up she comes, Next morning, ‘Chop off her
  6416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead’--and they chop it off.  ‘Ring up Fair Rosamun.’  Fair Rosamun
  6417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanswers the bell.  Next morning, ‘Chop off her head.’  And he made every
  6418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had
  6419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a
  6420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbook, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the
  6421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcase.  You don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip
  6422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof ourn is one of the cleanest I’ve struck in history.  Well, Henry he
  6423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttakes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How
  6424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoes he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show?  No.  All of a
  6425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks
  6426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on.  That was
  6427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_his_ style--he never give anybody a chance.  He had suspicions of his
  6428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfather, the Duke of Wellington.  Well, what did he do?  Ask him to show
  6429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup?  No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.  S’pose people

  6431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t S’pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set
  6432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown there and see that he done it--what did he do?  He always done the
  6433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother thing. S’pose he opened his mouth--what then?  If he didn’t shut it
  6434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup powerful quick he’d lose a lie every time.  That’s the kind of a bug
  6435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHenry was; and if we’d a had him along ‘stead of our kings he’d a fooled
  6436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat town a heap worse than ourn done.  I don’t say that ourn is lambs,
  6437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause they ain’t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they
  6438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway.  All I say is, kings is kings,
  6439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand you got to make allowances.  Take them all around, they’re a mighty
  6440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tornery lot. It’s the way they’re raised.”
  6441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.”
  6443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, they all do, Jim.  We can’t help the way a king smells; history
  6445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t tell no way.”
  6446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now de duke, he’s a tolerble likely man in some ways.”
  6448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, a duke’s different.  But not very different.  This one’s
  6450	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta middling hard lot for a duke.  When he’s drunk there ain’t no
  6451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnear-sighted man could tell him from a king.”
  6452	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6453	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, anyways, I doan’ hanker for no mo’ un um, Huck.  Dese is all I

  6455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6456	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s the way I feel, too, Jim.  But we’ve got them on our hands, and we
  6457	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to remember what they are, and make allowances.  Sometimes I wish we
  6458	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould hear of a country that’s out of kings.”
  6459	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6460	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhat was the use to tell Jim these warn’t real kings and dukes?  It
  6461	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said:  you
  6462	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t tell them from the real kind.
  6463	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6464	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went to sleep, and Jim didn’t call me when it was my turn.  He often
  6465	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone that.  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
  6466	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  I
  6467	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t take notice nor let on.  I knowed what it was about.  He was
  6468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low
  6469	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand homesick; because he hadn’t ever been away from home before in his
  6470	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlife; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
  6471	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfolks does for their’n.  It don’t seem natural, but I reckon it’s so.
  6472	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I
  6473	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas asleep, and saying, “Po’ little ‘Lizabeth! po’ little Johnny! it’s
  6474	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty hard; I spec’ I ain’t ever gwyne to see you no mo’, no mo’!”  He
  6475	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a mighty good nigger, Jim was.
  6476	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6477	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
  6478	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tones; and by and by he says:
  6479	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6480	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What makes me feel so bad dis time ‘uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder

  6516	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6517	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXIV.
  6518	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6519	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
  6520	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the
  6521	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim
  6522	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a few
  6523	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to
  6524	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him
  6525	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all
  6526	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runaway
  6527	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay
  6528	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it.
  6529	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6530	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed
  6531	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim up in King Lear’s outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a
  6532	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhite horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint
  6533	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,
  6534	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdull, solid blue, like a man that’s been drownded nine days.  Blamed if
  6535	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the warn’t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took
  6536	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand wrote out a sign on a shingle so:
  6537	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6538	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.
  6539	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6540	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five
  6541	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight
  6542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all
  6543	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself
  6544	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfree and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop
  6545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like
  6546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.
  6547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he
  6548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn’t only look like he was
  6549	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead, he looked considerable more than that.
  6550	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6551	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThese rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was
  6552	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso much money in it, but they judged it wouldn’t be safe, because maybe
  6553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn’t hit no
  6554	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tproject that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he’d
  6555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn’t put up
  6556	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop
  6557	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover to t’other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence
  6558	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all
  6559	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his’n
  6560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king’s
  6561	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never
  6562	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked
  6563	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he’d take off
  6564	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand
  6565	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand good and pious that you’d say he had walked right out of the ark,
  6566	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I
  6567	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away
  6568	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple
  6569	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof hours, taking on freight.  Says the king:
  6570	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Seein’ how I’m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.
  6572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLouis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.  Go for the steamboat,
  6573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHuckleberry; we’ll come down to the village on her.”
  6574	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.
  6576	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went
  6577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.  Pretty soon we come to
  6578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the
  6579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a
  6580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of big carpet-bags by him.
  6581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Run her nose in shore,” says the king.  I done it.  “Wher’ you bound
  6583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor, young man?”
  6584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“For the steamboat; going to Orleans.”
  6586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Git aboard,” says the king.  “Hold on a minute, my servant ‘ll he’p you
  6588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith them bags.  Jump out and he’p the gentleman, Adolphus”--meaning me,
  6589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see.
  6590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6591	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap was
  6592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.
  6593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he’d come
  6594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he
  6595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.  The
  6596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung fellow says:
  6597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he
  6599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome mighty near getting here in time.’  But then I says again, ‘No, I
  6600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t be paddling up the river.’  You
  6601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_ain’t_ him, are you?”
  6602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, my name’s Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander
  6604	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBlodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ the Lord’s poor servants.
  6605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But still I’m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving
  6606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin time, all the same, if he’s missed anything by it--which I hope he
  6607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thasn’t.”
  6608	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get that all
  6610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn’t
  6611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything
  6612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing
  6613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\telse all these three weeks; hadn’t seen him since they was boys
  6614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether--and hadn’t ever seen his brother William at all--that’s the deef
  6615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand dumb one--William ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five.  Peter and
  6616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGeorge were the only ones that come out here; George was the married
  6617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrother; him and his wife both died last year.  Harvey and William’s the
  6618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got here
  6619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin time.”
  6620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did anybody send ‘em word?”
  6622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter
  6624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well this
  6625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls was too young to
  6626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he
  6627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn’t seem
  6628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto care much to live.  He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and
  6629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWilliam, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can’t
  6630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbear to make a will.  He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d
  6631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the
  6632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tproperty divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right--for George
  6633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t leave nothing.  And that letter was all they could get him to put
  6634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta pen to.”
  6635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  6652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfourteen--that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has a

  6654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”
  6656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and they
  6658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t going to let them come to no harm.  There’s Hobson, the Babtis’
  6659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpreacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,
  6660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the
  6661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow Bartley, and--well, there’s a lot of them; but these are the ones
  6662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when
  6663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the wrote home; so Harvey ‘ll know where to look for friends when he gets
  6664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there.”
  6665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
  6667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat young fellow.  Blamed if he didn’t inquire about everybody and
  6668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about
  6669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPeter’s business--which was a tanner; and about George’s--which was a
  6670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarpenter; and about Harvey’s--which was a dissentering minister; and so
  6671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton, and so on.  Then he says:
  6672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”
  6674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t stop
  6676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere.  When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail.  A Cincinnati boat
  6677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill, but this is a St. Louis one.”
  6678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Was Peter Wilks well off?”
  6680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned he
  6682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleft three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”
  6683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“When did you say he died?”
  6685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’t say, but it was last night.”
  6687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”
  6689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, ‘bout the middle of the day.”
  6691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go, one time or
  6693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re all right.”
  6694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, sir, it’s the best way.  Ma used to always say that.”
  6696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she
  6698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost
  6699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up
  6700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:
  6701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new
  6703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarpet-bags.  And if he’s gone over to t’other side, go over there and
  6704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgit him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now.”
  6705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  When
  6707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a
  6708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlog, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had
  6709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid it--every last word of it.  And all the time he was a-doing it he
  6710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for
  6711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta slouch. I can’t imitate him, and so I ain’t a-going to try to; but he
  6712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treally done it pretty good.  Then he says:
  6713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”
  6715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef
  6717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they waited for a
  6718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteamboat.
  6719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,
  6721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut they didn’t come from high enough up the river; but at last there
  6722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we went
  6723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted
  6724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and
  6725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid they wouldn’t land us.  But the king was ca’m.  He says:
  6726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
  6728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry ‘em, can’t it?”
  6729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the
  6731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvillage they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down when
  6732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:
  6733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher’ Mr. Peter Wilks lives?” they
  6735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,
  6736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What d’ I tell you?”  Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:
  6737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_
  6739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlive yesterday evening.”
  6740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up
  6742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his
  6743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback, and says:
  6744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,
  6746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s too, too hard!”
  6747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to
  6749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn’t drop a carpet-bag and
  6750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbust out a-crying.  If they warn’t the beatenest lot, them two frauds,
  6751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ever I struck.
  6752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all
  6754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill
  6755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about
  6756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this brother’s last moments, and the king he told it all over again on
  6757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner
  6758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike they’d lost the twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anything
  6759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike it, I’m a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human
  6760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trace.
  6761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  6765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXV.
  6766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people
  6768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on
  6769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir coats as they come.  Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,
  6770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.  The windows and
  6771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:
  6772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is it _them_?”
  6774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:
  6776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You bet it is.”
  6778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the
  6780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree girls was standing in the door.  Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but
  6781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat don’t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her
  6782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles
  6783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for
  6784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!
  6785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again
  6786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat last and have such good times.
  6787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then he
  6789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so
  6790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen him and the duke, with a hand across each other’s shoulder, and
  6791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tt’other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody
  6792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,
  6793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople saying “Sh!” and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
  6794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.  And when they got there
  6795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then
  6796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and
  6797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen they put their arms around each other’s necks, and hung their chins
  6798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover each other’s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,
  6799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never see two men leak the way they done.  And, mind you, everybody
  6800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything
  6801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t’other on
  6802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tt’other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the
  6803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.  Well, when it come
  6804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and
  6805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls,
  6806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a
  6807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tword, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand
  6808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running
  6809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give
  6810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe next woman a show.  I never see anything so disgusting.
  6811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and
  6813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworks himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and
  6814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother
  6815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long
  6816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjourney of four thousand mile, but it’s a trial that’s sweetened and
  6817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he
  6818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthanks them out of his heart and out of his brother’s heart, because out
  6819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof their mouths they can’t, words being too weak and cold, and all that
  6820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers
  6821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying
  6822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfit to bust.
  6823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the
  6825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their
  6826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church
  6827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tletting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and
  6828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and
  6829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbully.
  6830	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his
  6832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the
  6833	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up
  6834	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying
  6835	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that
  6836	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will
  6837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tname the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon
  6838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and
  6839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.
  6840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tRev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
  6842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t’other
  6843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld, and the preacher was pinting him right.  Lawyer Bell was away up
  6844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Louisville on business.  But the rest was on hand, and so they all
  6845	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;
  6846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then they shook hands with the duke and didn’t say nothing, but just
  6847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst
  6848	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the made all sorts of signs with his hands and said “Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo”
  6849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t all the time, like a baby that can’t talk.
  6850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty
  6852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts
  6853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to
  6854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGeorge’s family, or to Peter.  And he always let on that Peter wrote him
  6855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe things; but that was a lie:  he got every blessed one of them out of
  6856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.
  6857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the
  6859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking he read it out loud and cried over it.  It give the dwelling-house
  6860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
  6861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t(which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and
  6862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tland (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold
  6863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down
  6864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcellar.  So these two frauds said they’d go and fetch it up, and have
  6865	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.
  6866	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag
  6867	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them
  6868	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyaller-boys.  My, the way the king’s eyes did shine!  He slaps the duke
  6869	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the shoulder and says:
  6870	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6871	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, _this_ ain’t bully nor noth’n!  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Why,
  6872	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don’t_ it?”
  6873	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6874	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke allowed it did.  They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them
  6875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the
  6876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking says:
  6877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no use talkin’; bein’ brothers to a rich dead man and

  6881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, in the long run.  I’ve tried ‘em all, and ther’ ain’t no better

  6883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMost everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on
  6885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrust; but no, they must count it.  So they counts it, and it comes out
  6886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfour hundred and fifteen dollars short.  Says the king:
  6887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
  6889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars?”
  6890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6891	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it.  Then
  6892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke says:
  6893	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckon
  6895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s the way of it.  The best way’s to let it go, and keep still about
  6896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.  We can spare it.”
  6897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it.  I don’t k’yer noth’n ‘bout
  6899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat--it’s the _count_ I’m thinkin’ about.  We want to be awful square
  6900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand open and above-board here, you know.  We want to lug this h-yer
  6901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther’ ain’t noth’n
  6902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuspicious.  But when the dead man says ther’s six thous’n dollars, you
  6903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow, we don’t want to--”
  6904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on,” says the duke.  “Le’s make up the deffisit,” and he begun to
  6906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thaul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.
  6907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a most amaz’n’ good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin’ clever
  6909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead on you,” says the king.  “Blest if the old Nonesuch ain’t a heppin’
  6910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus out agin,” and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them
  6911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup.
  6912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.
  6914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say,” says the duke, “I got another idea.  Le’s go up stairs and count
  6916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.”
  6917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good land, duke, lemme hug you!  It’s the most dazzling idea ‘at ever a
  6919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman struck.  You have cert’nly got the most astonishin’ head I ever see.
  6920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOh, this is the boss dodge, ther’ ain’t no mistake ‘bout it.  Let ‘em
  6921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this ‘ll lay ‘em out.”
  6922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king
  6924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty
  6925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\telegant little piles.  Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their
  6926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchops.  Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin
  6927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto swell himself up for another speech.  He says:
  6928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by
  6930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem that’s left behind in the vale of sorrers.  He has done generous by
  6931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that’s left
  6932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfatherless and motherless.  Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he
  6933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould a done _more_ generous by ‘em if he hadn’t ben afeard o’ woundin’
  6934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this dear William and me.  Now, _wouldn’t_ he?  Ther’ ain’t no question
  6935	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘bout it in _my_ mind.  Well, then, what kind o’ brothers would it be
  6936	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ‘d stand in his way at sech a time?  And what kind o’ uncles would
  6937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit be that ‘d rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these ‘at he loved
  6938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso at sech a time?  If I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I’ll
  6939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjest ask him.” He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to
  6940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and
  6941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his
  6942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,
  6943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.  Then the king says,
  6944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I knowed it; I reckon _that ‘ll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels
  6945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it.  Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it
  6946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_all_.  It’s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.”
  6947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the
  6949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.  And
  6950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the
  6951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands off of them frauds, saying all the time:
  6952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!”
  6954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased
  6956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and
  6957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,
  6958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody
  6959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was
  6960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall busy listening.  The king was saying--in the middle of something he’d
  6961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted in on--
  6962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“--they bein’ partickler friends o’ the diseased.  That’s why they’re
  6964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinvited here this evenin’; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody;
  6965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it’s fitten that
  6966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this funeral orgies sh’d be public.”
  6967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and
  6969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke
  6970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the couldn’t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,
  6971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Obsequies_, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and
  6972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treaching it over people’s heads to him.  The king he reads it and puts
  6973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit in his pocket, and says:
  6974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart’s_ aluz right.  Asks me
  6976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make ‘em all
  6977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twelcome.  But he needn’t a worried--it was jest what I was at.”
  6978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he weaves along again, perfectly ca’m, and goes to dropping in his
  6980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfuneral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.  And
  6981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he done it the third time he says:
  6982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I say orgies, not because it’s the common term, because it
  6984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t--obsequies bein’ the common term--but because orgies is the right
  6985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tterm. Obsequies ain’t used in England no more now--it’s gone out.  We
  6986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay orgies now in England.  Orgies is better, because it means the thing
  6987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’re after more exact.  It’s a word that’s made up out’n the Greek
  6988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover
  6989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup; hence in_ter._  So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public
  6990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfuneral.”
  6991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was the _worst_ I ever struck.  Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed
  6993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright in his face.  Everybody was shocked.  Everybody says, “Why,
  6994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_doctor_!” and Abner Shackleford says:
  6995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Robinson, hain’t you heard the news?  This is Harvey Wilks.”
  6997	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6998	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:
  6999	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7000	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is it my poor brother’s dear good friend and physician?  I--”
  7001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Keep your hands off of me!” says the doctor.  “_You_ talk like an
  7003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEnglishman, _don’t_ you?  It’s the worst imitation I ever heard.  _You_
  7004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPeter Wilks’s brother!  You’re a fraud, that’s what you are!”
  7005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, how they all took on!  They crowded around the doctor and tried to
  7007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey ‘d
  7008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name,
  7009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt
  7010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHarvey’s feelings and the poor girl’s feelings, and all that.  But it
  7011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended
  7012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be an Englishman and couldn’t imitate the lingo no better than what
  7013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the did was a fraud and a liar.  The poor girls was hanging to the king
  7014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_.  He
  7015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  7016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was your father’s friend, and I’m your friend; and I warn you as a
  7018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfriend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
  7019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tharm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
  7020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,
  7021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas he calls it.  He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here
  7022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and
  7023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these
  7024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoolish friends here, who ought to know better.  Mary Jane Wilks, you
  7025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.  Now listen
  7026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it.  Will you?”
  7027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome!  She
  7029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  7030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Here_ is my answer.”  She hove up the bag of money and put it in the
  7032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking’s hands, and says, “Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for
  7033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme and my sisters any way you want to, and don’t give us no receipt for
  7034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
  7035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the
  7037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thare-lip done the same on the other.  Everybody clapped their hands and
  7038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his
  7039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead and smiled proud.  The doctor says:
  7040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter.  But I warn you all that a
  7042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime ‘s coming when you’re going to feel sick whenever you think of this
  7043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday.” And away he went.
  7044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, doctor,” says the king, kinder mocking him; “we’ll try and
  7046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget ‘em to send for you;” which made them all laugh, and they said it
  7047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a prime good hit.
  7048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  7053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
  7055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for
  7056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tUncle William, and she’d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was
  7057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
  7058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.
  7059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.
  7060	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7061	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was
  7062	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplain but nice.  She said she’d have her frocks and a lot of other traps
  7063	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey’s way, but he said
  7064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey warn’t.  The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was
  7065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.  There was an
  7066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts
  7067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room
  7068	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith.  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
  7069	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese fixings, and so don’t disturb them.  The duke’s room was pretty
  7070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmall, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.
  7071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7072	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
  7073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I stood behind the king and the duke’s chairs and waited on them,
  7074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the niggers waited on the rest.  Mary Jane she set at the head of
  7075	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits
  7076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried
  7077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to
  7078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforce out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,
  7079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand said so--said “How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?” and
  7080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where, for the land’s sake, _did_ you get these amaz’n pickles?” and
  7081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a
  7082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsupper, you know.
  7083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7084	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen
  7085	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up
  7086	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe things.  The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest
  7087	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I didn’t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes.  She says:
  7088	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you ever see the king?”
  7090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7091	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who?  William Fourth?  Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.”  I
  7092	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on.  So when I says he
  7093	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoes to our church, she says:
  7094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What--regular?”
  7096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--regular.  His pew’s right over opposite ourn--on t’other side the
  7098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpulpit.”
  7099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I thought he lived in London?”
  7101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he does.  Where _would_ he live?”
  7103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?”

  7106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see I was up a stump.  I had to let on to get choked with a chicken
  7107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbone, so as to get time to think how to get down again.  Then I says:
  7108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield.  That’s
  7110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.”
  7111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, how you talk--Sheffield ain’t on the sea.”
  7113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, who said it was?”
  7115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you did.”
  7117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I _didn’t_ nuther.”
  7119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You did!”
  7121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’t.”
  7123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You did.”
  7125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I never said nothing of the kind.”
  7127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what _did_ you say, then?”
  7129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Said he come to take the sea _baths_--that’s what I said.”
  7131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t on the
  7133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsea?”
  7134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any Congress-water?”
  7136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  7138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”
  7140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, no.”
  7142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea
  7144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbath.”
  7145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How does he get it, then?”
  7147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels.  There
  7149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the palace at Sheffield they’ve got furnaces, and he wants his water
  7150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thot.  They can’t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.
  7151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey haven’t got no conveniences for it.”
  7152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I see, now.  You might a said that in the first place and saved
  7154	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime.”
  7155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was
  7157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable and glad.  Next, she says:
  7158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you go to church, too?”
  7160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--regular.”
  7162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where do you set?”
  7164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, in our pew.”
  7166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7167	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Whose_ pew?”
  7168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7169	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey’s.”
  7170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“His’n?  What does _he_ want with a pew?”
  7172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wants it to set in.  What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?”
  7174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I thought he’d be in the pulpit.”
  7176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tRot him, I forgot he was a preacher.  I see I was up a stump again, so I
  7178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplayed another chicken bone and got another think.  Then I says:
  7179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a church?”
  7181	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, what do they want with more?”
  7183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What!--to preach before a king?  I never did see such a girl as you.
  7185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey don’t have no less than seventeen.”
  7186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Seventeen!  My land!  Why, I wouldn’t set out such a string as that,
  7188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot if I _never_ got to glory.  It must take ‘em a week.”
  7189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks, they don’t _all_ of ‘em preach the same day--only _one_ of ‘em.”
  7191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what does the rest of ‘em do?”
  7193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, nothing much.  Loll around, pass the plate--and one thing or
  7195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother.  But mainly they don’t do nothing.”
  7196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what are they _for_?”
  7198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, they’re for _style_.  Don’t you know nothing?”
  7200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t _want_ to know no such foolishness as that.  How is
  7202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tservants treated in England?  Do they treat ‘em better ‘n we treat our
  7203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tniggers?”
  7204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_No_!  A servant ain’t nobody there.  They treat them worse than dogs.”
  7206	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7207	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t they give ‘em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year’s
  7208	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tweek, and Fourth of July?”
  7209	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7210	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, just listen!  A body could tell _you_ hain’t ever been to England
  7211	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby that.  Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year’s
  7212	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tend to year’s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger
  7213	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshows, nor nowheres.”
  7214	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7215	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nor church?”
  7216	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7217	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nor church.”
  7218	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7219	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But _you_ always went to church.”
  7220	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7221	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I was gone up again.  I forgot I was the old man’s servant.  But
  7222	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnext minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was
  7223	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifferent from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he
  7224	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the
  7225	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaw.  But I didn’t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she
  7226	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t satisfied.  She says:
  7227	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7228	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honest injun, now, hain’t you been telling me a lot of lies?”
  7229	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7230	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honest injun,” says I.
  7231	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7232	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“None of it at all?”
  7233	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7234	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“None of it at all.  Not a lie in it,” says I.
  7235	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7236	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lay your hand on this book and say it.”
  7237	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7238	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see it warn’t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and
  7239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid it.  So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:
  7240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, I’ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I’ll
  7242	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelieve the rest.”
  7243	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7244	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is it you won’t believe, Joe?” says Mary Jane, stepping in with
  7245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSusan behind her.  “It ain’t right nor kind for you to talk so to him,
  7246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand him a stranger and so far from his people.  How would you like to be
  7247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttreated so?”
  7248	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7249	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before
  7250	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’re hurt.  I hain’t done nothing to him.  He’s told some stretchers,
  7251	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckon, and I said I wouldn’t swallow it all; and that’s every bit
  7252	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand grain I _did_ say.  I reckon he can stand a little thing like that,
  7253	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t he?”
  7254	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t care whether ‘twas little or whether ‘twas big; he’s here in
  7256	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tour house and a stranger, and it wasn’t good of you to say it.  If you
  7257	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn’t to
  7258	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.”
  7259	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7260	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Mam, he said--”
  7261	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7262	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It don’t make no difference what he _said_--that ain’t the thing.  The
  7263	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make
  7264	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim remember he ain’t in his own country and amongst his own folks.”
  7265	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7266	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I’m letting that old reptile rob
  7267	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther of her money!
  7268	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7269	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you’ll believe me, she did give
  7270	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHare-lip hark from the tomb!
  7271	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7272	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSays I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I’m letting him rob her
  7273	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof her money!
  7274	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely
  7276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain--which was her way; but when she got done there warn’t hardly
  7277	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything left o’ poor Hare-lip.  So she hollered.
  7278	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, then,” says the other girls; “you just ask his pardon.”
  7280	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7281	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe done it, too; and she done it beautiful.  She done it so beautiful
  7282	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so
  7283	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe could do it again.
  7284	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7285	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says to myself, this is _another_ one that I’m letting him rob her of
  7286	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther money.  And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves
  7287	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.  I felt so
  7288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind’s made up;
  7289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll hive that money for them or bust.
  7290	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7291	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.  When
  7292	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got by myself I went to thinking the thing over.  I says to myself,
  7293	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?  No--that
  7294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would
  7295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  No--I
  7296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdasn’t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they’ve got the
  7297	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney, and they’d slide right out and get away with it.  If she was to
  7298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetch in help I’d get mixed up in the business before it was done with,
  7299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judge.  No; there ain’t no good way but one.  I got to steal that
  7300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won’t suspicion
  7301	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat I done it. They’ve got a good thing here, and they ain’t a-going
  7302	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto leave till they’ve played this family and this town for all they’re
  7303	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworth, so I’ll find a chance time enough. I’ll steal it and hide it; and
  7304	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby and by, when I’m away down the river, I’ll write a letter and tell
  7305	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane where it’s hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,
  7306	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause the doctor maybe hasn’t let up as much as he lets on he has; he
  7307	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmight scare them out of here yet.
  7308	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7309	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo, thinks I, I’ll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall was
  7310	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark, but I found the duke’s room, and started to paw around it with
  7311	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy hands; but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king to let
  7312	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to
  7313	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn’t do nothing
  7314	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twithout a candle, and I dasn’t light one, of course.  So I judged I’d
  7315	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.  About that time
  7316	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I
  7317	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treached for it, but it wasn’t where I thought it would be; but I touched
  7318	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and
  7319	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.
  7320	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7321	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to
  7322	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn’t found the bed
  7323	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it’s kind of natural to hide under
  7324	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, and
  7325	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe king says:
  7326	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7327	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin’ short, because it’s better for
  7328	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than up here givin’ ‘em a
  7329	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchance to talk us over.”
  7330	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7331	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, this is it, Capet.  I ain’t easy; I ain’t comfortable.  That
  7332	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoctor lays on my mind.  I wanted to know your plans.  I’ve got a
  7333	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotion, and I think it’s a sound one.”
  7334	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7335	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is it, duke?”
  7336	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7337	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip
  7338	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit down the river with what we’ve got.  Specially, seeing we got it so
  7339	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teasy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of
  7340	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcourse we allowed to have to steal it back.  I’m for knocking off and
  7341	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlighting out.”
  7342	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7343	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat made me feel pretty bad.  About an hour or two ago it would a been
  7344	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The
  7345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking rips out and says:
  7346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What!  And not sell out the rest o’ the property?  March off like
  7348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ dollars’ worth o’
  7349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tproperty layin’ around jest sufferin’ to be scooped in?--and all good,
  7350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsalable stuff, too.”
  7351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn’t
  7353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to go no deeper--didn’t want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_
  7354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey had.
  7355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, how you talk!” says the king.  “We sha’n’t rob ‘em of nothing at
  7357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall but jest this money.  The people that _buys_ the property is the
  7358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuff’rers; because as soon ‘s it’s found out ‘at we didn’t own it--which
  7359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t be long after we’ve slid--the sale won’t be valid, and it ‘ll all
  7360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo back to the estate.  These yer orphans ‘ll git their house back agin,
  7361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand that’s enough for _them_; they’re young and spry, and k’n easy
  7362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tearn a livin’.  _they_ ain’t a-goin to suffer.  Why, jest think--there’s
  7363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t nigh so well off.  Bless you, _they_
  7364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t got noth’n’ to complain of.”
  7365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all
  7367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that
  7368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoctor hanging over them.  But the king says:
  7369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cuss the doctor!  What do we k’yer for _him_?  Hain’t we got all the
  7371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfools in town on our side?  And ain’t that a big enough majority in any
  7372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttown?”
  7373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they got ready to go down stairs again.  The duke says:
  7375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t think we put that money in a good place.”
  7377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat cheered me up.  I’d begun to think I warn’t going to get a hint of
  7379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno kind to help me.  The king says:
  7380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why?”
  7382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because Mary Jane ‘ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know
  7384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds
  7385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and put ‘em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and
  7386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot borrow some of it?”
  7387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Your head’s level agin, duke,” says the king; and he comes a-fumbling
  7389	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder the curtain two or three foot from where I was.  I stuck tight to
  7390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them
  7391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what
  7392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d better do if they did catch me.  But the king he got the bag before
  7393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned
  7394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was around.  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw
  7395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two
  7396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only
  7397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmakes up the feather-bed, and don’t turn over the straw tick only about
  7398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwice a year, and so it warn’t in no danger of getting stole now.
  7399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I knowed better.  I had it out of there before they was half-way
  7401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown stairs.  I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I
  7402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould get a chance to do better.  I judged I better hide it outside
  7403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the
  7404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thouse a good ransacking:  I knowed that very well.  Then I turned in,
  7405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith my clothes all on; but I couldn’t a gone to sleep if I’d a wanted
  7406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business.  By and by I
  7407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid
  7408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was
  7409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to happen.  But nothing did.
  7410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn’t
  7412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.
  7413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXVII.
  7418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring.  So I tiptoed
  7420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong, and got down stairs all right.  There warn’t a sound anywheres.
  7421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that
  7422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.  The door
  7423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a
  7424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but
  7425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see there warn’t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I
  7426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn’t there.
  7427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.  I
  7428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trun in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I
  7429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee to hide the bag was in the coffin.  The lid was shoved along about
  7430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta foot, showing the dead man’s face down in there, with a wet cloth over
  7431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, and his shroud on.  I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just
  7432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was
  7433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.
  7434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe person coming was Mary Jane.  She went to the coffin, very soft, and
  7436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see
  7437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe begun to cry, though I couldn’t hear her, and her back was to me.  I
  7438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I’d make sure them
  7439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatchers hadn’t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything
  7440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all right.  They hadn’t stirred.
  7441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing
  7443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplaying out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much
  7444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresk about it.  Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because
  7445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to
  7446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain’t the
  7447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing that’s going to happen; the thing that’s going to happen is, the
  7448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney ‘ll be found when they come to screw on the lid.  Then the king
  7449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘ll get it again, and it ‘ll be a long day before he gives anybody
  7450	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide
  7451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown and get it out of there, but I dasn’t try it.  Every minute it was
  7452	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin
  7453	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my
  7454	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands that nobody hadn’t hired me to take care of.  I don’t wish to be
  7455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.
  7456	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7457	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the
  7458	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatchers was gone.  There warn’t nobody around but the family and the
  7459	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow Bartley and our tribe.  I watched their faces to see if anything
  7460	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad been happening, but I couldn’t tell.
  7461	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7462	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they
  7463	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then
  7464	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till
  7465	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.  I see the coffin
  7466	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to look in under it, with
  7467	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfolks around.
  7468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7469	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took
  7470	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour
  7471	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the
  7472	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead man’s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was
  7473	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding
  7474	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a
  7475	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle.  There warn’t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on
  7476	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a
  7477	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfuneral than they do at other places except church.
  7478	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7479	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his
  7480	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblack gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last
  7481	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttouches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,
  7482	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand making no more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved people
  7483	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done
  7484	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit with nods, and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place over
  7485	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever
  7486	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee; and there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.
  7487	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7488	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready
  7489	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
  7490	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcolicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one
  7491	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat had a good thing, according to my notion.  Then the Reverend Hobson
  7492	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\topened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most
  7493	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toutrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only
  7494	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right
  7495	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you
  7496	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t hear yourself think.  It was right down awkward, and nobody
  7497	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t seem to know what to do.  But pretty soon they see that
  7498	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,
  7499	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you worry--just depend on me.”  Then he stooped down and begun
  7500	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people’s
  7501	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theads.  So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and
  7502	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two
  7503	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsides of the room, he disappears down cellar.  Then in about two seconds
  7504	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or
  7505	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn
  7506	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk where he left off.  In a minute or two here comes this undertaker’s
  7507	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and
  7508	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tglided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his
  7509	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,
  7510	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover the people’s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “_He
  7511	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad a rat_!”  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to
  7512	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this place.  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,
  7513	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause naturally they wanted to know.  A little thing like that don’t
  7514	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes a man to be
  7515	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked up to and liked.  There warn’t no more popular man in town than
  7516	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat that undertaker was.
  7517	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7518	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and
  7519	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and
  7520	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
  7521	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoffin with his screw-driver.  I was in a sweat then, and watched him
  7522	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as
  7523	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.  So there I was!  I
  7524	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t know whether the money was in there or not.  So, says I, s’pose
  7525	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether
  7526	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto write to Mary Jane or not? S’pose she dug him up and didn’t find
  7527	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get
  7528	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thunted up and jailed; I’d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at
  7529	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall; the thing’s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I’ve worsened it
  7530	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta hundred times, and I wish to goodness I’d just let it alone, dad fetch
  7531	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe whole business!
  7532	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7533	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces
  7534	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain--I couldn’t help it, and I couldn’t rest easy.  But nothing come of
  7535	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit; the faces didn’t tell me nothing.
  7536	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7537	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,
  7538	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his
  7539	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcongregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must
  7540	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.  He was
  7541	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could
  7542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstay longer, but they said they could see it couldn’t be done.  And he
  7543	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and
  7544	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed
  7545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled
  7546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told
  7547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.  Them
  7548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them
  7549	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting fooled and lied to so, but I didn’t see no safe way for me to
  7550	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchip in and change the general tune.
  7551	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7552	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, blamed if the king didn’t bill the house and the niggers and all
  7553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;
  7554	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.
  7555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7556	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls’ joy
  7557	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot the first jolt.  A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king
  7558	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called
  7559	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their
  7560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmother down the river to Orleans.  I thought them poor girls and them
  7561	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tniggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each
  7562	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.  The girls
  7563	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid they hadn’t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold
  7564	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway from the town.  I can’t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of
  7565	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other’s necks
  7566	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand crying; and I reckon I couldn’t a stood it all, but would a had
  7567	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn’t knowed the sale warn’t no

  7569	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7570	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out
  7571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
  7572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren that way.  It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he
  7573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell
  7574	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou the duke was powerful uneasy.
  7575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7576	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext day was auction day.  About broad day in the morning the king and
  7577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look
  7578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat there was trouble.  The king says:
  7579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Was you in my room night before last?”
  7581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, your majesty”--which was the way I always called him when nobody but
  7583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tour gang warn’t around.
  7584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Was you in there yisterday er last night?”
  7586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, your majesty.”
  7588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honor bright, now--no lies.”
  7590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7591	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honor bright, your majesty, I’m telling you the truth.  I hain’t been
  7592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed
  7593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit to you.”
  7594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says:
  7596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Have you seen anybody else go in there?”
  7598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.”
  7600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stop and think.”
  7602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:
  7604	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.”
  7606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoth of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn’t ever
  7608	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texpected it, and then like they _had_.  Then the duke says:
  7609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What, all of them?”
  7611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don’t think I ever see them
  7613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall come _out_ at once but just one time.”
  7614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello!  When was that?”
  7616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It was the day we had the funeral.  In the morning.  It warn’t early,
  7618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause I overslept.  I was just starting down the ladder, and I see
  7619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.”
  7620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, go on, _go_ on!  What did they do?  How’d they act?”
  7622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They didn’t do nothing.  And they didn’t act anyway much, as fur as I
  7624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they’d shoved in
  7625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere to do up your majesty’s room, or something, s’posing you was up;
  7626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand found you _warn’t_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the
  7627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn’t already waked you
  7628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup.”
  7629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Great guns, _this_ is a go!” says the king; and both of them looked
  7631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty sick and tolerable silly.  They stood there a-thinking and
  7632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a
  7633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle raspy chuckle, and says:
  7634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.  They let on
  7636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be _sorry_ they was going out of this region!  And I believed they
  7637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.  Don’t ever tell _me_
  7638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tany more that a nigger ain’t got any histrionic talent.  Why, the way
  7639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey played that thing it would fool _anybody_.  In my opinion, there’s
  7640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta fortune in ‘em.  If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn’t want a
  7641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter lay-out than that--and here we’ve gone and sold ‘em for a song.
  7642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Yes, and ain’t privileged to sing the song yet.  Say, where _is_ that
  7643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsong--that draft?”
  7644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“In the bank for to be collected.  Where _would_ it be?”
  7646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, _that’s_ all right then, thank goodness.”
  7648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSays I, kind of timid-like:
  7650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is something gone wrong?”
  7652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king whirls on me and rips out:
  7654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“None o’ your business!  You keep your head shet, and mind y’r own
  7656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taffairs--if you got any.  Long as you’re in this town don’t you forgit
  7657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_that_--you hear?”  Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it
  7658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand say noth’n’:  mum’s the word for _us_.”
  7659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and
  7661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  7662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick sales _and_ small profits!  It’s a good business--yes.”
  7664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king snarls around on him and says:
  7666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ‘em out so quick.  If the
  7668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprofits has turned out to be none, lackin’ considable, and none to
  7669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarry, is it my fault any more’n it’s yourn?”
  7670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, _they’d_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn’t_ if I could a got
  7672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy advice listened to.”
  7673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped
  7675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround and lit into _me_ again.  He give me down the banks for not
  7676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting
  7677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up.  And then
  7678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not
  7679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he’d be
  7680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblamed if he’d ever do it again.  So they went off a-jawing; and I felt
  7681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdreadful glad I’d worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn’t
  7682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone the niggers no harm by it.
  7683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXVIII.
  7688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBY and by it was getting-up time.  So I come down the ladder and started
  7690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor down-stairs; but as I come to the girls’ room the door was open, and
  7691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she’d
  7692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen packing things in it--getting ready to go to England.  But she
  7693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her
  7694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands, crying.  I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.  I
  7695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent in there and says:
  7696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I
  7698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t--most always.  Tell me about it.”
  7699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she done it.  And it was the niggers--I just expected it.  She said
  7701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn’t
  7702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and
  7703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe children warn’t ever going to see each other no more--and then busted
  7704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:
  7705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain’t _ever_ going to see each other any
  7707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore!”
  7708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it!” says I.
  7710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLaws, it was out before I could think!  And before I could budge she
  7712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrows her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it
  7713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_again_, say it _again_!
  7714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close
  7716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very
  7717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\timpatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and
  7718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teased-up, like a person that’s had a tooth pulled out.  So I went to
  7719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstudying it out.  I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells
  7720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,
  7721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthough I ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; but it
  7722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest if it
  7723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.
  7724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it’s
  7725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it.  Well, I
  7726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance it; I’ll up and tell the
  7727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttruth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of
  7728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpowder and touching it off just to see where you’ll go to. Then I says:
  7729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you
  7731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould go and stay three or four days?”
  7732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s.  Why?”
  7734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never mind why yet.  If I’ll tell you how I know the niggers will see
  7736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teach other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ how
  7737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop’s and stay four days?”
  7738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Four days!” she says; “I’ll stay a year!”
  7740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right,” I says, “I don’t want nothing more out of _you_ than just
  7742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour word--I druther have it than another man’s kiss-the-Bible.”  She
  7743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, “If you don’t mind it,
  7744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll shut the door--and bolt it.”
  7745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I come back and set down again, and says:
  7747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you holler.  Just set still and take it like a man.  I got to
  7749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it’s a
  7750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain’t no help for
  7751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.  These uncles of yourn ain’t no uncles at all; they’re a couple of
  7752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrauds--regular dead-beats.  There, now we’re over the worst of it, you
  7753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan stand the rest middling easy.”
  7754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal
  7756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher
  7757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck
  7758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she
  7759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflung herself on to the king’s breast at the front door and he kissed
  7760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face
  7761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafire like sunset, and says:
  7762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The brute!  Come, don’t waste a minute--not a _second_--we’ll have them
  7764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”
  7765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSays I:
  7767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cert’nly.  But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop’s, or--”
  7769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh,” she says, “what am I _thinking_ about!” she says, and set right
  7771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown again.  “Don’t mind what I said--please don’t--you _won’t,_ now,
  7772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_will_ you?” Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that
  7773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI said I would die first.  “I never thought, I was so stirred up,” she
  7774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays; “now go on, and I won’t do so any more.  You tell me what to do,
  7775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand whatever you say I’ll do it.”
  7776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I’m fixed so
  7778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I
  7779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdruther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would
  7780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget me out of their claws, and I’d be all right; but there’d be another
  7781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperson that you don’t know about who’d be in big trouble.  Well, we
  7782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to save _him_, hain’t we?  Of course.  Well, then, we won’t blow on
  7783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.”
  7784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSaying them words put a good idea in my head.  I see how maybe I could
  7786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.
  7787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard
  7788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto answer questions but me; so I didn’t want the plan to begin working
  7789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill pretty late to-night.  I says:
  7790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and you won’t have to stay
  7792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther.  How fur is it?”
  7793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.”
  7795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that ‘ll answer.  Now you go along out there, and lay low
  7797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home
  7798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain--tell them you’ve thought of something.  If you get here before
  7799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\televen put a candle in this window, and if I don’t turn up wait _till_
  7800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\televen, and _then_ if I don’t turn up it means I’m gone, and out of the
  7801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get

  7803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good,” she says, “I’ll do it.”
  7805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“And if it just happens so that I don’t get away, but get took up along
  7807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,
  7808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand you must stand by me all you can.”
  7809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stand by you! indeed I will.  They sha’n’t touch a hair of your head!”
  7811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said
  7812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, too.
  7813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If I get away I sha’n’t be here,” I says, “to prove these rapscallions
  7815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do it if I _was_ here.  I could swear
  7816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey was beats and bummers, that’s all, though that’s worth something.
  7817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, there’s others can do that better than what I can, and they’re
  7818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople that ain’t going to be doubted as quick as I’d be.  I’ll tell you
  7819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow to find them.  Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.  There--‘Royal
  7820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNonesuch, Bricksville.’  Put it away, and don’t lose it.  When the
  7821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcourt wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to
  7822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBricksville and say they’ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,
  7823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand ask for some witnesses--why, you’ll have that entire town down here
  7824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.  And they’ll come a-biling, too.”
  7825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged we had got everything fixed about right now.  So I says:
  7827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Just let the auction go right along, and don’t worry.  Nobody don’t
  7829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction
  7830	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton accounts of the short notice, and they ain’t going out of this till
  7831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey get that money; and the way we’ve fixed it the sale ain’t going to
  7832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcount, and they ain’t going to get no money.  It’s just like the way
  7833	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was with the niggers--it warn’t no sale, and the niggers will be
  7834	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback before long.  Why, they can’t collect the money for the _niggers_
  7835	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyet--they’re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”
  7836	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now, and then I’ll start
  7838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight for Mr. Lothrop’s.”
  7839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Deed, _that_ ain’t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,” I says, “by no manner
  7841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof means; go _before_ breakfast.”
  7842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why?”
  7844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7845	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?”
  7846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don’t know.  What was it?”
  7848	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, it’s because you ain’t one of these leather-face people.  I don’t
  7850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant no better book than what your face is.  A body can set down and
  7851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tread it off like coarse print.  Do you reckon you can go and face your
  7852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--”
  7853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There, there, don’t!  Yes, I’ll go before breakfast--I’ll be glad to.
  7855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd leave my sisters with them?”
  7856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes; never mind about them.  They’ve got to stand it yet a while.  They
  7858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmight suspicion something if all of you was to go.  I don’t want you to
  7859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was
  7860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.
  7861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I’ll fix it with all of
  7862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem. I’ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say
  7863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or
  7864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see a friend, and you’ll be back to-night or early in the morning.”
  7865	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7866	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love given to
  7867	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.”
  7868	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7869	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, it sha’n’t be.”  It was well enough to tell _her_ so--no
  7870	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tharm in it.  It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it’s
  7871	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe little things that smooths people’s roads the most, down here below;
  7872	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn’t cost nothing.  Then
  7873	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:  “There’s one more thing--that bag of money.”
  7874	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think
  7876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_how_ they got it.”
  7877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, you’re out, there.  They hain’t got it.”
  7879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, who’s got it?”
  7881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wish I knowed, but I don’t.  I _had_ it, because I stole it from
  7883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I’m
  7884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafraid it ain’t there no more.  I’m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I’m
  7885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.  I
  7886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I
  7887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome to, and run--and it warn’t a good place.”
  7888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, stop blaming yourself--it’s too bad to do it, and I won’t allow
  7890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t your fault.  Where did you hide it?”
  7891	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I
  7893	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
  7894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcorpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.  So
  7895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a minute I didn’t say nothing; then I says:
  7896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’d ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don’t
  7898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind letting me off; but I’ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and
  7899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop’s, if you want to.  Do you
  7900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon that ‘ll do?”
  7901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes.”
  7903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I wrote:  “I put it in the coffin.  It was in there when you was
  7905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrying there, away in the night.  I was behind the door, and I was
  7906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”
  7907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by
  7909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\therself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own
  7910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it
  7911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the
  7912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand, hard, and says:
  7913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Good_-bye.  I’m going to do everything just as you’ve told me; and if
  7915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI don’t ever see you again, I sha’n’t ever forget you and I’ll think of
  7916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou a many and a many a time, and I’ll _pray_ for you, too!”--and she was
  7917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone.
  7918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPray for me!  I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that was more
  7920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnearer her size.  But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that
  7921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind.  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there
  7922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t no back-down to her, I judge.  You may say what you want to, but
  7923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in
  7924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy opinion she was just full of sand.  It sounds like flattery, but it
  7925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t no flattery.  And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she
  7926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlays over them all.  I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I see
  7927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther go out of that door; no, I hain’t ever seen her since, but I reckon
  7928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying
  7929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe would pray for me; and if ever I’d a thought it would do any good
  7930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or bust.
  7931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see
  7933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther go.  When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:
  7934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7935	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the name of them people over on t’other side of the river that
  7936	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou all goes to see sometimes?”
  7937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey says:
  7939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There’s several; but it’s the Proctors, mainly.”
  7941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s the name,” I says; “I most forgot it.  Well, Miss Mary Jane she
  7943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold me to tell you she’s gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of
  7944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem’s sick.”
  7945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Which one?”
  7947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it’s--”
  7949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sakes alive, I hope it ain’t _Hanner_?”
  7951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m sorry to say it,” I says, “but Hanner’s the very one.”
  7953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My goodness, and she so well only last week!  Is she took bad?”
  7955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no name for it.  They set up with her all night, Miss Mary
  7957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJane said, and they don’t think she’ll last many hours.”
  7958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Only think of that, now!  What’s the matter with her?”
  7960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI couldn’t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:
  7962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mumps.”
  7964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mumps your granny!  They don’t set up with people that’s got the
  7966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmumps.”
  7967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They don’t, don’t they?  You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.
  7969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t These mumps is different.  It’s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.”
  7970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How’s it a new kind?”
  7972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because it’s mixed up with other things.”
  7974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What other things?”
  7976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and
  7978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don’t know what all.”
  7979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My land!  And they call it the _mumps_?”
  7981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s what Miss Mary Jane said.”
  7983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?”
  7985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, because it _is_ the mumps.  That’s what it starts with.”
  7987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, ther’ ain’t no sense in it.  A body might stump his toe, and take

  8033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, maybe you’re right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.”
  8035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she’s gone out a while,
  8037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway, so he won’t be uneasy about her?”
  8038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.  She says, ‘Tell them to
  8040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I’ve run over
  8041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river to see Mr.’--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family your
  8042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--”
  8043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain’t it?”
  8045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can’t ever seem to
  8047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tremember them, half the time, somehow.  Yes, she said, say she has run
  8048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy
  8049	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had
  8050	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit than anybody else; and she’s going to stick to them till they say
  8051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’ll come, and then, if she ain’t too tired, she’s coming home; and
  8052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif she is, she’ll be home in the morning anyway.  She said, don’t say
  8053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which ‘ll be
  8054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying
  8055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe house; I know it, because she told me so herself.”
  8056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right,” they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and
  8058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.
  8059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8060	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverything was all right now.  The girls wouldn’t say nothing because
  8061	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther
  8062	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of
  8063	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDoctor Robinson.  I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I
  8064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned Tom Sawyer couldn’t a done it no neater himself.  Of course he
  8065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould a throwed more style into it, but I can’t do that very handy, not
  8066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeing brung up to it.
  8067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8068	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end
  8069	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man
  8070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the
  8071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tauctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little
  8072	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing
  8073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.
  8074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8075	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was
  8076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.  So
  8077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was
  8078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor wanting to swallow _everything_.  Well, whilst they was at it a
  8079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping
  8080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:
  8081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Here’s_ your opposition line! here’s your two sets o’ heirs to old
  8083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPeter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!”
  8084	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8085	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8086	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8087	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8088	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXIX.
  8089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a
  8091	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls,
  8092	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.  But I didn’t see no
  8093	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjoke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some
  8094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see any.  I reckoned they’d turn pale.  But no, nary a pale did
  8095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but
  8096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that’s
  8097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoogling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed
  8098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in
  8099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the
  8100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld.  Oh, he done it admirable.  Lots of the principal people
  8101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side.  That old
  8102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.  Pretty
  8103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an
  8104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEnglishman--not the king’s way, though the king’s _was_ pretty good for
  8105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tan imitation.  I can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitate
  8106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:
  8107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“This is a surprise to me which I wasn’t looking for; and I’ll
  8109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tacknowledge, candid and frank, I ain’t very well fixed to meet it and
  8110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanswer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he’s broke his
  8111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tarm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the
  8112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight by a mistake.  I am Peter Wilks’ brother Harvey, and this is his
  8113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrother William, which can’t hear nor speak--and can’t even make signs to
  8114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamount to much, now’t he’s only got one hand to work them with.  We are
  8115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twho we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can
  8116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprove it. But up till then I won’t say nothing more, but go to the hotel
  8117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand wait.”
  8118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and
  8120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblethers out:
  8121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain’t_ it?--and very convenient, too,
  8123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a fraud that’s got to make signs, and ain’t learnt how.  Lost
  8124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir baggage! That’s _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the
  8125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_circumstances_!”
  8126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,
  8128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor maybe half a dozen.  One of these was that doctor; another one was
  8129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind
  8130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and
  8131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and
  8132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone
  8133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along
  8134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the
  8135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:
  8136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when’d you come to this
  8138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttown?”
  8139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.
  8141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But what time o’ day?”
  8143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“In the evenin’--‘bout an hour er two before sundown.”
  8145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_How’d_ you come?”
  8147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.”
  8149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, how’d you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_’--in a
  8151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcanoe?”
  8152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I warn’t up at the Pint in the mornin’.”
  8154	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a lie.”
  8156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSeveral of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
  8158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told man and a preacher.
  8159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Preacher be hanged, he’s a fraud and a liar.  He was up at the Pint
  8161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat mornin’.  I live up there, don’t I?  Well, I was up there, and
  8162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was up there.  I see him there.  He come in a canoe, along with Tim
  8163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCollins and a boy.”
  8164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe doctor he up and says:
  8166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8167	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”
  8168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8169	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon I would, but I don’t know.  Why, yonder he is, now.  I know
  8170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim perfectly easy.”
  8171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was me he pointed at.  The doctor says:
  8173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Neighbors, I don’t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if
  8175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_these_ two ain’t frauds, I am an idiot, that’s all.  I think it’s our
  8176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduty to see that they don’t get away from here till we’ve looked into
  8177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.  We’ll take
  8178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese fellows to the tavern and affront them with t’other couple, and I
  8179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon we’ll find out _something_ before we get through.”
  8180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8181	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king’s friends; so
  8182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe all started.  It was about sundown.  The doctor he led me along by
  8183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.
  8184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and
  8186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched in the new couple.  First, the doctor says:
  8187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they’re
  8189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrauds, and they may have complices that we don’t know nothing about.
  8190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t If they have, won’t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter
  8191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWilks left?  It ain’t unlikely.  If these men ain’t frauds, they won’t
  8192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tobject to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove
  8193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’re all right--ain’t that so?”
  8194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody agreed to that.  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty
  8196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttight place right at the outstart.  But the king he only looked
  8197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsorrowful, and says:
  8198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain’t got no disposition
  8200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation
  8201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’ this misable business; but, alas, the money ain’t there; you k’n send
  8202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see, if you want to.”
  8203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where is it, then?”
  8205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8206	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it
  8207	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinside o’ the straw tick o’ my bed, not wishin’ to bank it for the few
  8208	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdays we’d be here, and considerin’ the bed a safe place, we not bein’
  8209	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to niggers, and suppos’n’ ‘em honest, like servants in England.
  8210	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The niggers stole it the very next mornin’ after I had went down
  8211	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstairs; and when I sold ‘em I hadn’t missed the money yit, so they got
  8212	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclean away with it.  My servant here k’n tell you ‘bout it, gentlemen.”
  8213	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8214	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn’t altogether
  8215	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelieve him.  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.  I said
  8216	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I
  8217	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up
  8218	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.
  8219	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t That was all they asked me.  Then the doctor whirls on me and says:
  8220	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8221	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Are _you_ English, too?”
  8222	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8223	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”
  8224	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8225	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had
  8226	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about
  8227	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsupper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and
  8228	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They
  8229	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his’n;
  8230	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the
  8231	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told gentleman was spinning truth and t’other one lies.  And by and by
  8232	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed
  8233	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the
  8234	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,
  8235	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn’t get pretty
  8236	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:
  8237	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8238	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Set down, my boy; I wouldn’t strain myself if I was you.  I reckon
  8239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou ain’t used to lying, it don’t seem to come handy; what you want is
  8240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpractice.  You do it pretty awkward.”
  8241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8242	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,
  8243	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway.
  8244	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:
  8246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If you’d been in town at first, Levi Bell--” The king broke in and
  8248	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treached out his hand, and says:
  8249	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8250	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, is this my poor dead brother’s old friend that he’s wrote so often
  8251	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout?”
  8252	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8253	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked
  8254	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side
  8255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:
  8256	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8257	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That ‘ll fix it.  I’ll take the order and send it, along with your
  8258	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrother’s, and then they’ll know it’s all right.”
  8259	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8260	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted
  8261	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;
  8262	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the
  8263	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer
  8264	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturns to the new old gentleman and says:
  8265	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8266	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”
  8267	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8268	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn’t read it.  The lawyer looked
  8269	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpowerful astonished, and says:
  8270	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8271	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it beats _me_”--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,
  8272	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand examined them, and then examined the old man’s writing, and then
  8273	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_them_ again; and then says:  “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;
  8274	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand here’s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn’t
  8275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrite them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell
  8276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here’s _this_ old
  8277	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgentleman’s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn’t
  8278	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrite them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain’t properly _writing_ at
  8279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall.  Now, here’s some letters from--”
  8280	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8281	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe new old gentleman says:
  8282	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8283	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother
  8284	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere--so he copies for me.  It’s _his_ hand you’ve got there, not mine.”
  8285	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8286	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Well_!” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things.  I’ve got some
  8287	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof William’s letters, too; so if you’ll get him to write a line or so we
  8288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan com--”
  8289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8290	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He _can’t_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman.  “If he
  8291	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters
  8292	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand mine too.  Look at both, please--they’re by the same hand.”
  8293	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe lawyer done it, and says:
  8295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I believe it’s so--and if it ain’t so, there’s a heap stronger
  8297	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresemblance than I’d noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I
  8298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthought we was right on the track of a solution, but it’s gone to grass,
  8299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpartly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain’t either of ‘em
  8300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWilkses”--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.
  8301	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8302	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn’t give in
  8303	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_then_! Indeed he wouldn’t.  Said it warn’t no fair test.  Said his
  8304	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn’t tried
  8305	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute
  8306	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and
  8307	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was
  8308	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:
  8309	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8310	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ve thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay
  8311	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”
  8312	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8313	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it.  We’re both here.”
  8314	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8315	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the old man turns towards the king, and says:
  8316	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8317	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”
  8318	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8319	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBlamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty quick, or he’d a
  8320	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsqushed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took
  8321	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make
  8322	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any
  8323	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?
  8324	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He whitened a little; he couldn’t help it; and it was mighty still in
  8325	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says
  8326	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI to myself, _now_ he’ll throw up the sponge--there ain’t no more use.
  8327	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, did he?  A body can’t hardly believe it, but he didn’t.  I reckon
  8328	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the thought he’d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so
  8329	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.
  8330	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:
  8331	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8332	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mf!  It’s a _very_ tough question, _ain’t_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k’n
  8333	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell you what’s tattooed on his breast.  It’s jest a small, thin, blue
  8334	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tarrow--that’s what it is; and if you don’t look clost, you can’t see it.
  8335	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t _now_ what do you say--hey?”
  8336	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8337	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out
  8338	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcheek.
  8339	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8340	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and
  8341	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this eye lights up like he judged he’d got the king _this_ time, and
  8342	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  8343	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8344	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There--you’ve heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter
  8345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWilks’ breast?”
  8346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoth of them spoke up and says:
  8348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We didn’t see no such mark.”
  8350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good!” says the old gentleman.  “Now, what you _did_ see on his breast
  8352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was
  8353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W”--and he marked
  8354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem that way on a piece of paper.  “Come, ain’t that what you saw?”
  8355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoth of them spoke up again, and says:
  8357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, we _didn’t_.  We never seen any marks at all.”
  8359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:
  8361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The whole _bilin_’ of ‘m ‘s frauds!  Le’s duck ‘em! le’s drown ‘em!
  8363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tle’s ride ‘em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there
  8364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,
  8365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
  8366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you
  8368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_please_!  There’s one way yet--let’s go and dig up the corpse and look.”
  8369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat took them.
  8371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer
  8373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the doctor sung out:
  8374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch
  8376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_them_ along, too!”
  8377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We’ll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don’t find them marks we’ll
  8379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlynch the whole gang!”
  8380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn’t no getting away, you
  8382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the
  8383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgraveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole
  8384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttown at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the
  8385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevening.
  8386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of town;
  8388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause now if I could tip her the wink she’d light out and save me, and
  8389	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblow on our dead-beats.
  8390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like
  8392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the
  8393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst
  8394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever
  8395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from
  8396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time
  8397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to
  8398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsave me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the
  8399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If they
  8400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t find them--
  8401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t think
  8403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful
  8404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the
  8405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He
  8406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.
  8407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
  8409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had
  8410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn’t
  8411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the
  8412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a
  8413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmile off, to borrow one.
  8414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain
  8416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come
  8417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took
  8418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute
  8419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the
  8420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the
  8421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark wiped it all out, and you couldn’t see nothing at all.
  8422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then
  8424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to
  8425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it
  8426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas awful.  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,
  8427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and
  8428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpanting.
  8429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,
  8431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand somebody sings out:
  8432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!”
  8434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and
  8436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit
  8437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout and shinned for the road in the dark there ain’t nobody can tell.
  8438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all
  8440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the
  8441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbuzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of
  8442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!
  8443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I struck the town I see there warn’t nobody out in the storm, so
  8445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the
  8446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmain one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and
  8447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and
  8448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdisappointed, I didn’t know why.  But at last, just as I was sailing by,
  8449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane’s window! and my heart swelled up
  8450	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind
  8451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme in the dark, and wasn’t ever going to be before me no more in this
  8452	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.
  8453	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8454	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
  8455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first
  8456	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime the lightning showed me one that wasn’t chained I snatched it and
  8457	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoved. It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with nothing but a rope.
  8458	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the
  8459	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle of the river, but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck the
  8460	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp
  8461	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I could afforded it.  But I didn’t.  As I sprung aboard I sung out:
  8462	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8463	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!  Glory be to goodness, we’re shut
  8464	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof them!”
  8465	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8466	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so
  8467	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfull of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up
  8468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King
  8469	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and
  8470	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlights out of me.  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and
  8471	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the
  8472	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking and the duke, but I says:
  8473	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8474	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!  Cut loose and
  8475	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlet her slide!”
  8476	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8477	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_
  8478	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and
  8479	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnobody to bother us.  I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack
  8480	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy heels a few times--I couldn’t help it; but about the third crack
  8481	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and
  8482	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlistened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out
  8483	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and
  8484	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmaking their skiff hum!  It was the king and the duke.
  8485	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8486	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was
  8487	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall I could do to keep from crying.
  8488	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8489	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  8493	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8494	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,
  8495	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
  8496	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8497	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tryin’ to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of our company,
  8498	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\they?”
  8499	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8500	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  8501	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8502	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, your majesty, we warn’t--_please_ don’t, your majesty!”
  8503	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8504	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I’ll shake the
  8505	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinsides out o’ you!”
  8506	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8507	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honest, I’ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.
  8508	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he
  8509	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry
  8510	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by
  8511	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsurprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go
  8512	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they’ll hang ye, sure!’ and I lit
  8513	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout.  It didn’t seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn’t do nothing,
  8514	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I didn’t want to be hung if I could get away.  So I never stopped
  8515	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trunning till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,
  8516	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor they’d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the
  8517	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke wasn’t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was
  8518	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn’t.”
  8519	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8520	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh,
  8521	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyes, it’s _mighty_ likely!” and shook me up again, and said he reckoned
  8522	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’d drownd me.  But the duke says:
  8523	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8524	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Leggo the boy, you old idiot!  Would _you_ a done any different?  Did
  8525	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou inquire around for _him_ when you got loose?  I don’t remember it.”
  8526	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8527	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in
  8528	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. But the duke says:
  8529	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8530	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You better a blame’ sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you’re
  8531	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe one that’s entitled to it most.  You hain’t done a thing from the
  8532	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky
  8533	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith that imaginary blue-arrow mark.  That _was_ bright--it was right
  8534	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown bully; and it was the thing that saved us.  For if it hadn’t been
  8535	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor that they’d a jailed us till them Englishmen’s baggage come--and
  8536	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took ‘em to the
  8537	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgraveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the
  8538	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texcited fools hadn’t let go all holts and made that rush to get a
  8539	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook we’d a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,
  8540	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo--longer than _we’d_ need ‘em.”
  8541	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of
  8543	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabsent-minded like:
  8544	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mf!  And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!”
  8546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat made me squirm!
  8548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8549	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, “_we_
  8550	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdid.”
  8551	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8552	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter about a half a minute the king drawls out:
  8553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8554	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Leastways, I did.”
  8555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8556	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says, the same way:
  8557	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8558	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“On the contrary, I did.”
  8559	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king kind of ruffles up, and says:
  8561	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8562	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Looky here, Bilgewater, what’r you referrin’ to?”
  8563	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8564	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says, pretty brisk:
  8565	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8566	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was _you_
  8567	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treferring to?”
  8568	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8569	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but I don’t know--maybe you was
  8570	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasleep, and didn’t know what you was about.”
  8571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke bristles up now, and says:
  8573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8574	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame’ fool?
  8575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDon’t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?”
  8576	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Yes_, sir!  I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!”
  8578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a lie!”--and the duke went for him.  The king sings out:
  8580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Take y’r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!”
  8582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says:
  8584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,
  8586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tintending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig
  8587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit up, and have it all to yourself.”
  8588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;
  8590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif you didn’t put the money there, say it, and I’ll b’lieve you, and
  8591	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake back everything I said.”
  8592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You old scoundrel, I didn’t, and you know I didn’t.  There, now!”
  8594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, I b’lieve you.  But answer me only jest this one more--now
  8596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_don’t_ git mad; didn’t you have it in your mind to hook the money and
  8597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thide it?”
  8598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:
  8600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t care if I _did_, I didn’t _do_ it, anyway.  But you not
  8602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.”
  8603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8604	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest.  I won’t say
  8605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI warn’t goin’ to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in
  8606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tahead o’ me.”
  8607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8608	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a lie!  You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--”
  8609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:
  8611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Nough!--I _own up!_”
  8613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier
  8615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan what I was feeling before.  So the duke took his hands off and
  8616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  8617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you.  It’s _well_ for you to set
  8619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere and blubber like a baby--it’s fitten for you, after the way
  8620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble
  8621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own
  8622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfather.  You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it
  8623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for ‘em.
  8624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_
  8625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat rubbage.  Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make
  8626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch
  8627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!”
  8628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:
  8630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t me.”
  8632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dry up!  I don’t want to hear no more out of you!” says the duke.  “And
  8634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_now_ you see what you GOT by it.  They’ve got all their own money back,
  8635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_.  G’long to bed, and
  8636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long ‘s _you_ live!”
  8637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,
  8639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
  8640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
  8641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms.  They
  8642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow
  8643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag
  8644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain.  That made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of course when they got
  8645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.
  8646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXI.
  8651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along
  8653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the river.  We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty
  8654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong ways from home.  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on
  8655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  It was the
  8656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and
  8657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdismal.  So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they
  8658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun to work the villages again.
  8659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFirst they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn’t make enough
  8661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor them both to get drunk on.  Then in another village they started
  8662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta dancing-school; but they didn’t know no more how to dance than a
  8663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped
  8664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin and pranced them out of town.  Another time they tried to go at
  8665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyellocution; but they didn’t yellocute long till the audience got up and
  8666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.  They tackled
  8667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmissionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and
  8668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little of everything; but they couldn’t seem to have no luck.  So at
  8669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she
  8670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfloated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the
  8671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.
  8672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
  8674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.
  8675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim and me got uneasy.  We didn’t like the look of it.  We judged they
  8676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.  We turned it
  8677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break
  8678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto somebody’s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money
  8679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbusiness, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an
  8680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagreement that we wouldn’t have nothing in the world to do with such
  8681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tactions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
  8682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we
  8683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of
  8684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told
  8685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see
  8686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (“House to
  8687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trob, you _mean_,” says I to myself; “and when you get through robbing it
  8688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the
  8689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft--and you’ll have to take it out in wondering.”) And he said if he
  8690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and
  8691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe was to come along.
  8692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we stayed where we was.  The duke he fretted and sweated around, and
  8694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in a mighty sour way.  He scolded us for everything, and we couldn’t
  8695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.
  8696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSomething was a-brewing, sure.  I was good and glad when midday come
  8697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_
  8698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchange on top of it.  So me and the duke went up to the village, and
  8699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the
  8700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
  8701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
  8702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this might, and so tight he couldn’t walk, and couldn’t do nothing to
  8703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king
  8704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and
  8705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like
  8706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a
  8707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong day before they ever see me and Jim again.  I got down there all
  8708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:
  8709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Set her loose, Jim! we’re all right now!”
  8711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut there warn’t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.  Jim was
  8713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone!  I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run
  8714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn’t
  8715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno use--old Jim was gone.  Then I set down and cried; I couldn’t help
  8716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. But I couldn’t set still long.  Pretty soon I went out on the road,
  8717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and
  8718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasked him if he’d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:
  8719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  8721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Whereabouts?” says I.

  8724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Down to Silas Phelps’ place, two mile below here.  He’s a runaway
  8725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger, and they’ve got him.  Was you looking for him?”
  8726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You bet I ain’t!  I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
  8728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tago, and he said if I hollered he’d cut my livers out--and told me to lay
  8729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown and stay where I was; and I done it.  Been there ever since; afeard
  8730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto come out.”
  8731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” he says, “you needn’t be afeard no more, becuz they’ve got him.
  8733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe run off f’m down South, som’ers.”
  8734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a good job they got him.”
  8736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I _reckon_!  There’s two hunderd dollars reward on him.  It’s
  8738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike picking up money out’n the road.”
  8739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I’d been big enough; I see him
  8741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_first_. Who nailed him?”
  8742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for
  8744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforty dollars, becuz he’s got to go up the river and can’t wait.  Think
  8745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’ that, now!  You bet _I’d_ wait, if it was seven year.”
  8746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s me, every time,” says I.  “But maybe his chance ain’t worth
  8748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more than that, if he’ll sell it so cheap.  Maybe there’s something
  8749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t straight about it.”
  8750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But it _is_, though--straight as a string.  I see the handbill myself.
  8752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t It tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells
  8753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe plantation he’s frum, below Newr_leans_.  No-sirree-_bob_, they
  8754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t no trouble ‘bout _that_ speculation, you bet you.  Say, gimme a
  8755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchaw tobacker, won’t ye?”
  8756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t have none, so he left.  I went to the raft, and set down in the
  8758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twigwam to think.  But I couldn’t come to nothing.  I thought till I wore
  8759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy head sore, but I couldn’t see no way out of the trouble.  After all
  8760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis long journey, and after all we’d done for them scoundrels, here it
  8761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because
  8762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make
  8763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty
  8764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdirty dollars.
  8765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOnce I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to
  8767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe a slave at home where his family was, as long as he’d _got_ to be a
  8768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslave, and so I’d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to
  8769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell Miss Watson where he was.  But I soon give up that notion for two
  8770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings: she’d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness
  8771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor leaving her, and so she’d sell him straight down the river again;
  8772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,
  8773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they’d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he’d feel ornery and
  8774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdisgraced. And then think of _me_!  It would get all around that Huck
  8775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFinn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see
  8776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody from that town again I’d be ready to get down and lick his boots
  8777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor shame.  That’s just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and
  8778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen he don’t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he
  8779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan hide it, it ain’t no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly. The more I
  8780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstudied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the
  8781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when
  8782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence
  8783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being
  8784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a
  8785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor old woman’s nigger that hadn’t ever done me no harm, and now was
  8786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowing me there’s One that’s always on the lookout, and ain’t a-going
  8787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,
  8788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I tried the best I
  8789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung
  8790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup wicked, and so I warn’t so much to blame; but something inside of me
  8791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkept saying, “There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and
  8792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif you’d a done it they’d a learnt you there that people that acts as
  8793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.”
  8794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I
  8796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  So
  8797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI kneeled down.  But the words wouldn’t come.  Why wouldn’t they?  It
  8798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from _me_, neither.  I
  8799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed very well why they wouldn’t come.  It was because my heart warn’t
  8800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright; it was because I warn’t square; it was because I was playing
  8801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdouble.  I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was
  8802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tholding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth
  8803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write
  8804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto that nigger’s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I
  8805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can’t pray a lie--I found
  8806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat out.
  8807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn’t know what to
  8809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo. At last I had an idea; and I says, I’ll go and write the letter--and
  8810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as
  8811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlight as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I
  8812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down
  8813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand wrote:
  8814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below
  8816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
  8817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treward if you send.
  8818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_Huck Finn._
  8820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever
  8822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfelt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn’t do it
  8823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking
  8824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
  8825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our
  8826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day
  8827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we
  8828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I
  8829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
  8830	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother kind.  I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ‘stead of
  8831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when
  8832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,
  8833	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call
  8834	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how
  8835	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling
  8836	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was
  8837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he’s
  8838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
  8839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was
  8841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and
  8842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then
  8843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays to myself:
  8844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8845	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, then, I’ll _go_ to hell”--and tore it up.
  8846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let
  8848	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the
  8849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,
  8850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhich was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t.  And
  8851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;
  8852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as
  8853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.
  8854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some
  8856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that
  8857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down
  8858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my
  8859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the
  8860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,
  8861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or
  8862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed
  8863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the woods,
  8864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and
  8865	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter
  8866	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
  8867	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8868	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on
  8869	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, “Phelps’s Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or
  8870	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn’t
  8871	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn’t mind,
  8872	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause I didn’t want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the
  8873	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from
  8874	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,
  8875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was
  8876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night
  8877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperformance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I
  8878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:
  8879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hel-_lo_!  Where’d _you_ come from?”  Then he says, kind of glad and
  8881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teager, “Where’s the raft?--got her in a good place?”
  8882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  8884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.”
  8886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he didn’t look so joyful, and says:
  8888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What was your idea for asking _me_?” he says.
  8890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8891	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says
  8892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s soberer; so I went
  8893	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered
  8894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch
  8895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,
  8896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him
  8897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after
  8898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.  We didn’t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the
  8899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcountry till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we
  8900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and
  8901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee it was gone, I says to myself, ‘They’ve got into trouble and had to
  8902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in
  8903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property
  8904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and
  8905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the
  8906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!”
  8907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blamed if I know--that is, what’s become of the raft.  That old fool had
  8909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery
  8910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but
  8911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and
  8912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfound the raft gone, we said, ‘That little rascal has stole our raft and
  8913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshook us, and run off down the river.’”
  8914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wouldn’t shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the
  8916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld, and the only property.”
  8917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we’d come to consider him
  8919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble
  8920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,
  8921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere warn’t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another
  8922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshake. And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where’s
  8923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ten cents? Give it here.”
  8924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to
  8926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the
  8927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney I had, and I hadn’t had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never
  8928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:
  8929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We’d skin him if he done
  8931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat!”
  8932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How can he blow?  Hain’t he run off?”
  8934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8935	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money’s
  8936	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone.”
  8937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Sold_ him?”  I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, and
  8939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.”
  8940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you can’t _get_ your nigger, that’s all--so dry up your
  8942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblubbering. Looky here--do you think _you’d_ venture to blow on us?
  8943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Blamed if I think I’d trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--”
  8944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes
  8946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore. I went on a-whimpering, and says:
  8947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t want to blow on nobody; and I ain’t got no time to blow, nohow.
  8949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got to turn out and find my nigger.”
  8950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on
  8952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:
  8953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you’ll
  8955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpromise you won’t blow, and won’t let the nigger blow, I’ll tell you
  8956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere to find him.”
  8957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I promised, and he says:
  8959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--” and then he stopped.  You see, he
  8961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to
  8962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstudy and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he
  8963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas. He wouldn’t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of
  8964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:
  8965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he
  8967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”
  8968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days.  And I’ll start this
  8970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery afternoon.”
  8971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No you wont, you’ll start _now_; and don’t you lose any time about it,
  8973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tneither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in
  8974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour head and move right along, and then you won’t get into trouble with
  8975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_us_, d’ye hear?”
  8976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I
  8978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to be left free to work my plans.
  8979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want
  8981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some
  8982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tidiots don’t require documents--leastways I’ve heard there’s such down
  8983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSouth here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward’s bogus,
  8984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmaybe he’ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for
  8985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting ‘em out.  Go ‘long now, and tell him anything you want to; but
  8986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind you don’t work your jaw any _between_ here and there.”
  8987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn’t look around, but I
  8989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out
  8990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before
  8991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps’.  I
  8992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
  8993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround, because I wanted to stop Jim’s mouth till these fellows could
  8994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget away.  I didn’t want no trouble with their kind.  I’d seen all I
  8995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.
  8996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  9000	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXII.
  9001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;
  9003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
  9004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
  9005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike everybody’s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers
  9006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it’s
  9007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspirits whispering--spirits that’s been dead ever so many years--and you
  9008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways think they’re talking about _you_.  As a general thing it makes a
  9009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbody wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.
  9010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPhelps’ was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they
  9012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall look alike.  A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out
  9013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different
  9014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlength, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when
  9015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the
  9016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the
  9017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs,
  9018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes
  9019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big
  9020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbroad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house
  9021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t’other
  9022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against
  9023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side;
  9024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by
  9025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there
  9026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away
  9027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place
  9028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then
  9029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.
  9030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and
  9032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted for the kitchen.  When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum
  9033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;
  9034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the
  9035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlonesomest sound in the whole world.
  9036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting
  9038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for
  9039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth
  9040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I left it alone.
  9041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went
  9043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.  And
  9044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch another powwow as they made!  In a quarter of a minute I was a kind
  9045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of
  9046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses
  9047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
  9048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.
  9049	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9050	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tA nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her
  9051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand, singing out, “Begone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!” and she
  9052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,
  9053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,
  9054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.  There ain’t
  9055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno harm in a hound, nohow.
  9056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger
  9058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their
  9059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmother’s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way
  9060	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey always do.  And here comes the white woman running from the house,
  9061	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick
  9062	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the
  9063	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame way the little niggers was doing.  She was smiling all over so she
  9064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould hardly stand--and says:
  9065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s _you_, at last!--_ain’t_ it?”
  9067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9068	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI out with a “Yes’m” before I thought.
  9069	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands
  9071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;
  9072	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand she couldn’t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, “You
  9073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law
  9074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsakes, I don’t care for that, I’m so glad to see you!  Dear, dear, it
  9075	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoes seem like I could eat you up!  Children, it’s your cousin Tom!--tell
  9076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim howdy.”
  9077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and
  9079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thid behind her.  So she run on:
  9080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get
  9082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour breakfast on the boat?”
  9083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9084	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI said I had got it on the boat.  So then she started for the house,
  9085	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.  When we got
  9086	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on
  9087	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:
  9088	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I’ve been hungry
  9090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it’s come
  9091	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more.  What kep’
  9092	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou?--boat get aground?”
  9093	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m--she--”
  9095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t say yes’m--say Aunt Sally.  Where’d she get aground?”
  9097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t rightly know what to say, because I didn’t know whether the
  9099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboat would be coming up the river or down.  But I go a good deal on
  9100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinstinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards
  9101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOrleans. That didn’t help me much, though; for I didn’t know the names
  9102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof bars down that way.  I see I’d got to invent a bar, or forget the
  9103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tname of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched
  9104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit out:
  9105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It warn’t the grounding--that didn’t keep us back but a little.  We
  9107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblowed out a cylinder-head.”
  9108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good gracious! anybody hurt?”
  9110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m.  Killed a nigger.”
  9112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it’s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.  Two years ago
  9114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old
  9115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.  And
  9116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI think he died afterwards.  He was a Baptist.  Your uncle Silas knowed
  9117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.  Yes, I
  9118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tremember now, he _did_ die.  Mortification set in, and they had to
  9119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamputate him. But it didn’t save him.  Yes, it was mortification--that
  9120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas it.  He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious
  9121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresurrection. They say he was a sight to look at.  Your uncle’s been up
  9122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the town every day to fetch you. And he’s gone again, not more’n an
  9123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thour ago; he’ll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road,
  9124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t you?--oldish man, with a--”
  9125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, I didn’t see nobody, Aunt Sally.  The boat landed just at daylight,
  9127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town
  9128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too
  9129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon; and so I come down the back way.”
  9130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’d you give the baggage to?”
  9132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nobody.”
  9134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, child, it ‘ll be stole!”
  9136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t,” I says.
  9138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”
  9140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was kinder thin ice, but I says:
  9142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something
  9144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers’
  9145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlunch, and give me all I wanted.”
  9146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was getting so uneasy I couldn’t listen good.  I had my mind on the
  9148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump
  9149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem a little, and find out who I was.  But I couldn’t get no show, Mrs.
  9150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPhelps kept it up and run on so.  Pretty soon she made the cold chills
  9151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstreak all down my back, because she says:
  9152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But here we’re a-running on this way, and you hain’t told me a word

  9155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about ‘m all every
  9156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of ‘m; and how they are, and what they’re doing, and what they told
  9157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.”
  9158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I see I was up a stump--and up it good.  Providence had stood by
  9160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.  I see it
  9161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t a bit of use to try to go ahead--I’d got to throw up my hand.  So
  9162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says to myself, here’s another place where I got to resk the truth.
  9163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind
  9164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bed, and says:
  9165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here he comes!  Stick your head down lower--there, that’ll do; you can’t

  9168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tChildren, don’t you say a word.”

  9170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see I was in a fix now.  But it warn’t no use to worry; there warn’t
  9171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from
  9172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder when the lightning struck.
  9173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then
  9175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bed hid him.  Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:
  9176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Has he come?”
  9178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” says her husband.
  9180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9181	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good-_ness_ gracious!” she says, “what in the warld can have become of
  9182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim?”
  9183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I can’t imagine,” says the old gentleman; “and I must say it makes me
  9185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdreadful uneasy.”
  9186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Uneasy!” she says; “I’m ready to go distracted!  He _must_ a come; and
  9188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve missed him along the road.  I _know_ it’s so--something tells me
  9189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso.”
  9190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Sally, I _couldn’t_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.”
  9192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say!  He must a come!  You must a
  9194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmissed him.  He--”
  9195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, don’t distress me any more’n I’m already distressed.  I don’t know
  9197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat in the world to make of it.  I’m at my wit’s end, and I don’t mind
  9198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tacknowledging ‘t I’m right down scared.  But there’s no hope that he’s
  9199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome; for he _couldn’t_ come and me miss him.  Sally, it’s terrible--just
  9200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tterrible--something’s happened to the boat, sure!”
  9201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Silas!  Look yonder!--up the road!--ain’t that somebody coming?”
  9203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.
  9205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPhelps the chance she wanted.  She stooped down quick at the foot of the
  9206	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the
  9207	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twindow there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and
  9208	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.  The old gentleman stared,
  9209	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
  9210	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9211	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, who’s that?”
  9212	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9213	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who do you reckon ‘t is?”
  9214	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9215	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t no idea.  Who _is_ it?”
  9216	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9217	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s _Tom Sawyer!_”
  9218	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9219	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy jings, I most slumped through the floor!  But there warn’t no time to
  9220	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tswap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on
  9221	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
  9222	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,
  9223	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the rest of the tribe.
  9224	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9225	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut if they was joyful, it warn’t nothing to what I was; for it was like
  9226	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeing born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.  Well, they froze
  9227	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn’t
  9228	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the
  9229	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.  And I
  9230	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texplained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of
  9231	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhite River, and it took us three days to fix it.  Which was all right,
  9232	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand worked first-rate; because _they_ didn’t know but what it would take
  9233	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree days to fix it.  If I’d a called it a bolthead it would a done
  9234	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust as well.
  9235	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9236	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNow I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty
  9237	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncomfortable all up the other.  Being Tom Sawyer was easy and
  9238	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
  9239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteamboat coughing along down the river.  Then I says to myself, s’pose
  9240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom Sawyer comes down on that boat?  And s’pose he steps in here any
  9241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep
  9242	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquiet?
  9243	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9244	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I couldn’t _have_ it that way; it wouldn’t do at all.  I must go
  9245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup the road and waylay him.  So I told the folks I reckoned I would go
  9246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup to the town and fetch down my baggage.  The old gentleman was for
  9247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and
  9248	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI druther he wouldn’t take no trouble about me.
  9249	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  9253	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXIII.
  9254	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a
  9256	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and
  9257	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaited till he come along.  I says “Hold on!” and it stopped alongside,
  9258	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed
  9259	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo or three times like a person that’s got a dry throat, and then says:
  9260	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9261	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t ever done you no harm.  You know that.  So, then, what you
  9262	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to come back and ha’nt _me_ for?”
  9263	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9264	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  9265	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9266	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t come back--I hain’t been _gone_.”
  9267	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9268	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn’t quite
  9269	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied yet.  He says:
  9270	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9271	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn’t on you.  Honest injun
  9272	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, you ain’t a ghost?”
  9273	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9274	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honest injun, I ain’t,” I says.
  9275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can’t somehow
  9277	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem to understand it no way.  Looky here, warn’t you ever murdered _at
  9278	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall?_”
  9279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9280	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No.  I warn’t ever murdered at all--I played it on them.  You come in
  9281	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there and feel of me if you don’t believe me.”
  9282	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9283	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me
  9284	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain he didn’t know what to do.  And he wanted to know all about it
  9285	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it
  9286	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thit him where he lived.  But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and
  9287	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told
  9288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?  He
  9289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, let him alone a minute, and don’t disturb him.  So he thought and
  9290	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthought, and pretty soon he says:
  9291	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9292	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s all right; I’ve got it.  Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on
  9293	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s your’n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the
  9294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thouse about the time you ought to; and I’ll go towards town a piece, and
  9295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;
  9296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand you needn’t let on to know me at first.”
  9297	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
  9299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right; but wait a minute.  There’s one more thing--a thing that
  9301	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_nobody_ don’t know but me.  And that is, there’s a nigger here that
  9302	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_--old Miss
  9303	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWatson’s Jim.”
  9304	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9305	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe says:
  9306	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9307	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What!  Why, Jim is--”
  9308	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9309	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe stopped and went to studying.  I says:
  9310	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9311	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know what you’ll say.  You’ll say it’s dirty, low-down business; but
  9312	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat if it is?  I’m low down; and I’m a-going to steal him, and I want
  9313	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou keep mum and not let on.  Will you?”
  9314	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9315	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHis eye lit up, and he says:
  9316	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9317	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll _help_ you steal him!”
  9318	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9319	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.  It was the most
  9320	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tastonishing speech I ever heard--and I’m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell
  9321	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable in my estimation.  Only I couldn’t believe it.  Tom Sawyer
  9322	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta _nigger-stealer!_
  9323	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9324	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, shucks!”  I says; “you’re joking.”
  9325	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9326	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I ain’t joking, either.”
  9327	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9328	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then,” I says, “joking or no joking, if you hear anything said
  9329	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a runaway nigger, don’t forget to remember that _you_ don’t know
  9330	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing about him, and I don’t know nothing about him.”
  9331	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9332	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his
  9333	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway and I drove mine.  But of course I forgot all about driving slow on
  9334	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too
  9335	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquick for that length of a trip.  The old gentleman was at the door, and
  9336	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the says:
  9337	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9338	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, this is wonderful!  Whoever would a thought it was in that mare
  9339	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto do it?  I wish we’d a timed her.  And she hain’t sweated a hair--not
  9340	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta hair. It’s wonderful.  Why, I wouldn’t take a hundred dollars for that
  9341	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorse now--I wouldn’t, honest; and yet I’d a sold her for fifteen before,
  9342	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand thought ‘twas all she was worth.”
  9343	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9344	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat’s all he said.  He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.
  9345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut it warn’t surprising; because he warn’t only just a farmer, he was
  9346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the
  9347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church
  9348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was
  9349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworth it, too.  There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and
  9350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone the same way, down South.
  9351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn about half an hour Tom’s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt
  9353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty
  9354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyards, and says:
  9355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, there’s somebody come!  I wonder who ‘tis?  Why, I do believe it’s
  9357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta stranger.  Jimmy” (that’s one of the children) “run and tell Lize to
  9358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput on another plate for dinner.”
  9359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
  9361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for
  9362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest, when he does come.  Tom was over the stile and starting for
  9363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we
  9364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all bunched in the front door.  Tom had his store clothes on, and an
  9365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taudience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.  In them circumstances
  9366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit warn’t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
  9367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuitable.  He warn’t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,
  9368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the come ca’m and important, like the ram.  When he got a-front of us he
  9369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box
  9370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat had butterflies asleep in it and he didn’t want to disturb them,
  9371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
  9372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?”
  9374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, my boy,” says the old gentleman, “I’m sorry to say ‘t your driver
  9376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thas deceived you; Nichols’s place is down a matter of three mile more.
  9377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCome in, come in.”
  9378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, “Too late--he’s out
  9380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof sight.”
  9381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, he’s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with
  9383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus; and then we’ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols’s.”
  9384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I _can’t_ make you so much trouble; I couldn’t think of it.  I’ll
  9386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twalk--I don’t mind the distance.”
  9387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But we won’t _let_ you walk--it wouldn’t be Southern hospitality to do
  9389	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. Come right in.”
  9390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, _do_,” says Aunt Sally; “it ain’t a bit of trouble to us, not a
  9392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbit in the world.  You must stay.  It’s a long, dusty three mile, and
  9393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe can’t let you walk.  And, besides, I’ve already told ‘em to put on
  9394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother plate when I see you coming; so you mustn’t disappoint us.  Come
  9395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright in and make yourself at home.”
  9396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be
  9398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpersuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger
  9399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made
  9400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother bow.
  9401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and
  9403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and
  9404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,
  9405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the
  9406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was
  9407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of
  9408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther hand, and says:
  9409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You owdacious puppy!”
  9411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked kind of hurt, and says:
  9413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m surprised at you, m’am.”
  9415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’re s’rp--Why, what do you reckon I am?  I’ve a good notion to take
  9417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?”
  9418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked kind of humble, and says:
  9420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’t mean nothing, m’am.  I didn’t mean no harm.  I--I--thought you’d
  9422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike it.”
  9423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you born fool!”  She took up the spinning stick, and it looked
  9425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.
  9426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t “What made you think I’d like it?”
  9427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t know.  Only, they--they--told me you would.”
  9429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_They_ told you I would.  Whoever told you’s _another_ lunatic.  I
  9431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever heard the beat of it.  Who’s _they_?”
  9432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, everybody.  They all said so, m’am.”
  9434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her
  9436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:
  9437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’s ‘everybody’?  Out with their names, or ther’ll be an idiot
  9439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshort.”
  9440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:
  9442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m sorry, and I warn’t expecting it.  They told me to.  They all told
  9444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme to.  They all said, kiss her; and said she’d like it.  They all said
  9445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--every one of them.  But I’m sorry, m’am, and I won’t do it no more--I
  9446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t, honest.”
  9447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You won’t, won’t you?  Well, I sh’d _reckon_ you won’t!”
  9449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9450	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m, I’m honest about it; I won’t ever do it again--till you ask me.”
  9451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9452	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Till I _ask_ you!  Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!
  9453	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I lay you’ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask
  9454	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou--or the likes of you.”
  9455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9456	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” he says, “it does surprise me so.  I can’t make it out, somehow.
  9457	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey said you would, and I thought you would.  But--” He stopped and
  9458	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye
  9459	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman’s, and says, “Didn’t
  9460	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_you_ think she’d like me to kiss her, sir?”
  9461	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9462	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b’lieve I didn’t.”
  9463	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9464	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he looks on around the same way to me, and says:
  9465	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9466	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, didn’t _you_ think Aunt Sally ‘d open out her arms and say, ‘Sid
  9467	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer--’”
  9468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9469	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My land!” she says, breaking in and jumping for him, “you impudent
  9470	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung rascal, to fool a body so--” and was going to hug him, but he
  9471	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfended her off, and says:
  9472	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9473	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, not till you’ve asked me first.”
  9474	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9475	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she didn’t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed
  9476	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he
  9477	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook what was left.  And after they got a little quiet again she says:
  9478	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9479	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn’t looking for _you_
  9480	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat all, but only Tom.  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but
  9481	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.”
  9482	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9483	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s because it warn’t _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,” he
  9484	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays; “but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me
  9485	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a
  9486	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me
  9487	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But it
  9488	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a mistake, Aunt Sally.  This ain’t no healthy place for a stranger
  9489	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto come.”
  9490	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9491	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; I
  9492	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thain’t been so put out since I don’t know when.  But I don’t care, I
  9493	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t mind the terms--I’d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to
  9494	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave you here. Well, to think of that performance!  I don’t deny it, I
  9495	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.”
  9496	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9497	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and
  9498	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven
  9499	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfamilies--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that’s laid
  9500	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of
  9501	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long
  9502	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn’t cool it a bit,
  9503	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tneither, the way I’ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.
  9504	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me
  9505	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn’t no use, they
  9506	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid
  9507	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto try to work up to it.  But at supper, at night, one of the little
  9508	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboys says:
  9509	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9510	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pa, mayn’t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”
  9511	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9512	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain’t going to be any; and you
  9513	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and
  9514	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the
  9515	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople; so I reckon they’ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town
  9516	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore this time.”
  9517	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9518	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo there it was!--but I couldn’t help it.  Tom and me was to sleep in the
  9519	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to
  9520	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the
  9521	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn’t believe anybody was
  9522	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn’t hurry up
  9523	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand give them one they’d get into trouble sure.
  9524	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9525	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOn the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,
  9526	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn’t come back no more, and
  9527	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our
  9528	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tRoyal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had
  9529	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of
  9530	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of
  9531	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
  9532	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;
  9533	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a
  9534	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was
  9535	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall over tar and feathers, and didn’t look like nothing in the
  9536	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big
  9537	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for
  9538	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn’t ever feel any
  9539	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to
  9540	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee.  Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.
  9541	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe see we was too late--couldn’t do no good.  We asked some stragglers
  9543	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very
  9544	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinnocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the
  9545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and
  9546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe house rose up and went for them.
  9547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we poked along back home, and I warn’t feeling so brash as I was
  9549	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though
  9550	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hadn’t done nothing.  But that’s always the way; it don’t make no
  9551	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifference whether you do right or wrong, a person’s conscience ain’t
  9552	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog that
  9553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t know no more than a person’s conscience does I would pison him.
  9554	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt takes up more room than all the rest of a person’s insides, and yet
  9555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t no good, nohow.  Tom Sawyer he says the same.
  9556	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9557	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9558	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9559	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXIV.
  9561	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9562	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE stopped talking, and got to thinking.  By and by Tom says:
  9563	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9564	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  I bet I
  9565	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow where Jim is.”
  9566	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9567	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No!  Where?”
  9568	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9569	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“In that hut down by the ash-hopper.  Why, looky here.  When we was at
  9570	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”
  9571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  9573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9574	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you think the vittles was for?”
  9575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9576	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“For a dog.”
  9577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So ‘d I. Well, it wasn’t for a dog.”
  9579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why?”
  9581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because part of it was watermelon.”
  9583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So it was--I noticed it.  Well, it does beat all that I never thought
  9585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a dog not eating watermelon.  It shows how a body can see and
  9586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t see at the same time.”
  9587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it
  9589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
  9590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom table--same key, I bet.  Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;
  9591	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand it ain’t likely there’s two prisoners on such a little plantation,
  9592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand where the people’s all so kind and good.  Jim’s the prisoner.  All
  9593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright--I’m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn’t give shucks
  9594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor any other way.  Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to
  9595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’ll take the one we like
  9596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe best.”
  9597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhat a head for just a boy to have!  If I had Tom Sawyer’s head I
  9599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown
  9600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I went to thinking out a plan,
  9601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right
  9602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplan was going to come from.  Pretty soon Tom says:
  9603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9604	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ready?”
  9605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” I says.
  9607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9608	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right--bring it out.”
  9609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My plan is this,” I says.  “We can easy find out if it’s Jim in there.
  9611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the
  9612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tisland.  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
  9613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told man’s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river
  9614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and
  9615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim used to do before.  Wouldn’t that plan work?”
  9616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Work_?  Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.  But it’s
  9618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo blame’ simple; there ain’t nothing _to_ it.  What’s the good of a
  9619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplan that ain’t no more trouble than that?  It’s as mild as goose-milk.
  9620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Why, Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soap
  9621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfactory.”
  9622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never said nothing, because I warn’t expecting nothing different; but
  9624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn’t
  9625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave none of them objections to it.
  9626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd it didn’t.  He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was
  9628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man
  9629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  So I was satisfied,
  9630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand said we would waltz in on it.  I needn’t tell what it was here,
  9631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way, it was.  I knowed he would be
  9632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchanging it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
  9633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbullinesses wherever he got a chance.  And that is what he done.
  9634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
  9636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tearnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
  9637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat was the thing that was too many for me.  Here was a boy that was
  9638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trespectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
  9639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thome that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
  9640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
  9641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twithout any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to
  9642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,
  9643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore everybody.  I _couldn’t_ understand it no way at all.  It was
  9644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toutrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be
  9645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save
  9646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:
  9647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you reckon I know what I’m about?  Don’t I generly know what I’m
  9649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout?”
  9650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  9652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Didn’t I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?”
  9654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  9656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Well_, then.”
  9658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat’s all he said, and that’s all I said.  It warn’t no use to say any
  9660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore; because when he said he’d do a thing, he always done it.  But I
  9661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just
  9662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlet it go, and never bothered no more about it.  If he was bound to have
  9663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit so, I couldn’t help it.
  9664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to
  9666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went through the yard
  9667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn’t make
  9668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by
  9669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and
  9670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe two sides; and on the side I warn’t acquainted with--which was the
  9671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnorth side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just
  9672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone stout board nailed across it.  I says:
  9673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here’s the ticket.  This hole’s big enough for Jim to get through if we
  9675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrench off the board.”
  9676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom says:
  9678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as
  9680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplaying hooky.  I should _hope_ we can find a way that’s a little more
  9681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomplicated than _that_, Huck Finn.”
  9682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then,” I says, “how ‘ll it do to saw him out, the way I done
  9684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore I was murdered that time?”
  9685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s more _like_,” he says.  “It’s real mysterious, and troublesome,
  9687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand good,” he says; “but I bet we can find a way that’s twice as long.
  9688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There ain’t no hurry; le’s keep on looking around.”
  9689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBetwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that
  9691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjoined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long
  9692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at
  9693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and
  9694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsearched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;
  9695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,
  9696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,
  9697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn’t no connection
  9698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith it; and there warn’t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but
  9699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.
  9700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and
  9701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;
  9702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now we’re all right.  We’ll _dig_ him out.  It ‘ll take about a week!”
  9704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have
  9706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto pull a buckskin latch-string, they don’t fasten the doors--but that
  9707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must
  9708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclimb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three
  9709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
  9710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbusted his brains out, he thought he’d got to give it up; but after he
  9711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this
  9712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime he made the trip.
  9713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins
  9715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it
  9716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through
  9717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling up
  9718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was
  9719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleaving, the key come from the house.
  9720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was
  9722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches
  9723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and
  9724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmaking him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of
  9725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstrange words and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so
  9726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so
  9727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout his troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do.
  9728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So Tom says:
  9729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?”
  9731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
  9733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:
  9734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur’us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at
  9736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘im?”
  9737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  9739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hunched Tom, and whispers:
  9741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You going, right here in the daybreak?  _that_ warn’t the plan.”
  9743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan _now_.”
  9745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much.  When we got in
  9747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure
  9748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough, and could see us; and he sings out:
  9749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, _Huck_!  En good _lan_’! ain’ dat Misto Tom?”
  9751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn’t know
  9753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a done it, because that nigger
  9754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbusted in and says:
  9755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”
  9757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and
  9759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of wondering, and says:
  9760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Does _who_ know us?”
  9762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”
  9764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”
  9766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What _put_ it dar?  Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out like he knowed
  9768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou?”
  9769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:
  9771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s mighty curious.  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?
  9773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t _what_ did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca’m, and says,
  9774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?”
  9775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOf course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:
  9777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.”
  9779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,
  9781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
  9782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you sing out?”
  9784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain’t said nothing, sah.”
  9786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Not a word?”
  9788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah, I hain’t said a word.”
  9790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you ever see us before?”
  9792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah; not as I knows on.”
  9794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
  9796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays, kind of severe:
  9797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway?  What made you think
  9799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomebody sung out?”
  9800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.
  9802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Dey’s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos’ kill me, dey sk’yers me so.
  9803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Please to don’t tell nobody ‘bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he’ll scole
  9804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme; ‘kase he say dey _ain’t_ no witches.  I jis’ wish to goodness he was
  9805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theah now--_den_ what would he say!  I jis’ bet he couldn’ fine no way to
  9806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgit aroun’ it _dis_ time.  But it’s awluz jis’ so; people dat’s _sot_,
  9807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstays sot; dey won’t look into noth’n’en fine it out f’r deyselves, en
  9808	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen _you_ fine it out en tell um ‘bout it, dey doan’ b’lieve you.”
  9809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom give him a dime, and said we wouldn’t tell nobody; and told him to
  9811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbuy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and
  9812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
  9813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.  If I was to
  9815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcatch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn’t give
  9816	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim up, I’d hang him.”  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to
  9817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim
  9818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
  9819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t ever let on to know us.  And if you hear any digging going on
  9821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnights, it’s us; we’re going to set you free.”
  9822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger
  9824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome back, and we said we’d come again some time if the nigger wanted
  9825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the
  9826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twitches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks
  9827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround then.
  9828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9830	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXV.
  9833	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9834	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down
  9835	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how
  9836	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;
  9837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that’s called
  9838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a
  9839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark place.  We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down
  9840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:
  9841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.
  9843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.
  9844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There ain’t no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a
  9845	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatchman.  There ain’t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.  And
  9846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere’s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his
  9847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed:  why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off
  9848	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe chain.  And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the
  9849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpunkin-headed nigger, and don’t send nobody to watch the nigger.  Jim
  9850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn’t be
  9851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  Why, drat it,
  9852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck, it’s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_
  9853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe difficulties.  Well, we can’t help it; we got to do the best we can
  9854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the materials we’ve got. Anyhow, there’s one thing--there’s more
  9855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thonor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,
  9856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere there warn’t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was
  9857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your
  9858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\town head.  Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.  When you
  9859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern’s
  9860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresky.  Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,
  9861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI believe.  Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to
  9862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake a saw out of the first chance we get.”
  9863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do we want of a saw?”
  9865	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9866	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do we _want_ of it?  Hain’t we got to saw the leg of Jim’s bed
  9867	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff, so as to get the chain loose?”
  9868	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9869	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
  9870	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff.”
  9871	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  9873	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinfant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.  Why, hain’t you ever read
  9874	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tany books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,
  9875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?  Who ever heard of getting a
  9876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?  No; the way all the
  9877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbest authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just
  9878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso, and swallow the sawdust, so it can’t be found, and put some dirt and
  9879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can’t see
  9880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno sign of it’s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.
  9881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen, the night you’re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip
  9882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff your chain, and there you are.  Nothing to do but hitch your
  9883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the
  9884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and
  9885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere’s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and
  9886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or
  9887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNavarre, or wherever it is. It’s gaudy, Huck.  I wish there was a moat
  9888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we’ll dig one.”
  9889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

  9894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut he never heard me.  He had forgot me and everything else.  He had
  9896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this chin in his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his

  9899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, it wouldn’t do--there ain’t necessity enough for it.”
  9900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“For what?”  I says.
  9902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, to saw Jim’s leg off,” he says.
  9904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good land!”  I says; “why, there ain’t _no_ necessity for it.  And what
  9906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?”
  9907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, some of the best authorities has done it.  They couldn’t get the
  9909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.  And a leg would
  9910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe better still.  But we got to let that go.  There ain’t necessity
  9911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough in this case; and, besides, Jim’s a nigger, and wouldn’t

  9913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe’ll let it go.  But there’s one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we
  9914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  And we
  9915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan send it to him in a pie; it’s mostly done that way.  And I’ve et

  9918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,” I says; “Jim ain’t got no use for a

  9920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He _has_ got use for it.  How _you_ talk, you better say; you don’t

  9927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall do; and _he’s_ got to, too.  Huck, you don’t ever seem to want to do
  9928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything that’s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the
  9929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. S’pose he _don’t_ do nothing with it? ain’t it there in his bed,
  9930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a clew, after he’s gone? and don’t you reckon they’ll want clews?
  9931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Of course they will.  And you wouldn’t leave them any?  That would be a
  9932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn’t_ it!  I never heard of such a thing.”
  9933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “if it’s in the regulations, and he’s got to have

  9946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby a hickry-bark ladder?  Why, it’s perfectly ridiculous.”
  9947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
  9948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you’ll take my

  9950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

 10003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.  So we
 10005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcleared out for the house.
 10006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
 10008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went
 10009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.  I called it borrowing,
 10010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn’t
 10011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tborrowing, it was stealing.  He said we was representing prisoners; and
 10012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprisoners don’t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
 10013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t blame them for it, either.  It ain’t no crime in a prisoner to
 10014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it’s his right; and
 10015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
 10016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
 10017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of prison with.  He said if we warn’t prisoners it would be a very
 10018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifferent thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when
 10019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the warn’t a prisoner.  So we allowed we would steal everything there was
 10020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat come handy.  And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,
 10021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he
 10022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it
 10023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we
 10024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.  But he said I didn’t
 10025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tneed it to get out of prison with; there’s where the difference was.
 10026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He said if I’d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim
 10027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.  So I let it go at
 10028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat, though I couldn’t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner
 10029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like
 10030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.
 10031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled
 10033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he
 10034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep
 10035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatch.  By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile
 10036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto talk.  He says:
 10037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Everything’s all right now except tools; and that’s easy fixed.”
 10039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tools?”  I says.
 10041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
 10043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tools for what?”
 10045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, to dig with.  We ain’t a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?”
 10047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ain’t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
 10049	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger out with?”  I says.
 10050	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:
 10052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,

 10073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof, and I’ve read all the books that gives any information about these

 10104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, we can’t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn’t
 10105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.
 10106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He’ll hear Jim ain’t from there.  Then his next move will be to
 10107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tadvertise Jim, or something like that.  So we can’t resk being as long
 10108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdigging him out as we ought to.  By rights I reckon we ought to be
 10109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta couple of years; but we can’t.  Things being so uncertain, what I
 10110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trecommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;
 10111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it
 10112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthirty-seven years.  Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the
 10113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst time there’s an alarm.  Yes, I reckon that ‘ll be the best way.”
 10114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, there’s _sense_ in that,” I says.  “Letting on don’t cost nothing;
 10116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tletting on ain’t no trouble; and if it’s any object, I don’t mind
 10117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tletting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.  It wouldn’t strain
 10118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme none, after I got my hand in.  So I’ll mosey along now, and smouch a
 10119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of case-knives.”
 10120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make a saw out of.”
 10122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, if it ain’t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,” I says,
 10124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“there’s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the
 10125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tweather-boarding behind the smoke-house.”
 10126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:
 10128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.  Run along and
 10130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmouch the knives--three of them.”  So I done it.
 10131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXVI.
 10136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
 10138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our
 10139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the
 10140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom
 10141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it, and
 10142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know there
 10143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most to the
 10144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.
 10145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then
 10146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t see
 10147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe’d done anything hardly.  At last I says:
 10148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,
 10150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom Sawyer.”
 10151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped
 10153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdigging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.
 10154	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he says:
 10155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work.  If we was prisoners
 10157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would, because then we’d have as many years as we wanted, and no
 10158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while
 10159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t get blistered, and
 10160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,
 10161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the way it ought to be done.  But _we_ can’t fool along; we got to
 10162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trush; we ain’t got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another
 10163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight this way we’d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get
 10164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell--couldn’t touch a case-knife with them sooner.”
 10165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”
 10167	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll tell you.  It ain’t right, and it ain’t moral, and I wouldn’t like
 10169	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit to get out; but there ain’t only just the one way:  we got to dig him
 10170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout with the picks, and _let on_ it’s case-knives.”
 10171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Now_ you’re _talking_!”  I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler
 10173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says.  “Picks is the thing, moral or no
 10174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoral; and as for me, I don’t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.
 10175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school
 10176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbook, I ain’t no ways particular how it’s done so it’s done.  What I
 10177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my
 10178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiest thing, that’s the thing
 10179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school
 10180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbook out with; and I don’t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks
 10181	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it nuther.”
 10182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like
 10184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t approve of it, nor I wouldn’t stand by
 10185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,
 10186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a body ain’t got no business doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and
 10187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,
 10188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_without_ any letting on, because you don’t know no better; but it
 10189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t for me, because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife.”
 10190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, and
 10192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
 10193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gimme a _case-knife_.”
 10195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around
 10197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took
 10198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit and went to work, and never said a word.
 10199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was always just that particular.  Full of principle.
 10201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,
 10203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as
 10204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for
 10205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing
 10206	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn’t come it, his
 10207	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands was so sore.  At last he says:
 10208	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10209	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no use, it can’t be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can’t
 10210	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou think of no way?”
 10211	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10212	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular.  Come up the stairs, and
 10213	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlet on it’s a lightning-rod.”
 10214	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10215	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he done it.
 10216	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10217	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,
 10218	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I
 10219	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin
 10220	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplates.  Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t ever see
 10221	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in the dog-fennel
 10222	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and
 10223	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:
 10224	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10225	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”
 10226	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10227	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”
 10228	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10229	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
 10230	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he
 10231	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no need to
 10232	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdecide on any of them yet.  Said we’d got to post Jim first.
 10233	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10234	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took
 10235	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard
 10236	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him.  Then we
 10237	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half
 10238	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe job was done.  We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, and
 10239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,
 10240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle
 10241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us
 10242	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thoney, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us
 10243	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,
 10244	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how
 10245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,
 10246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and
 10247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.
 10248	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old
 10249	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told
 10250	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt
 10251	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and
 10252	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:
 10253	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10254	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We’ll send you some things by them.”
 10255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10256	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI said, “Don’t do nothing of the kind; it’s one of the most jackass
 10257	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to me; went right
 10258	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton.  It was his way when he’d got his plans set.
 10259	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10260	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he told Jim how we’d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other
 10261	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlarge things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
 10262	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and
 10263	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe would put small things in uncle’s coat-pockets and he must steal them
 10264	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout; and we would tie things to aunt’s apron-strings or put them in her
 10265	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tapron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and
 10266	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
 10267	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn’t see
 10268	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
 10269	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just
 10270	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas Tom said.
 10271	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10272	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
 10273	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to
 10274	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed, with hands that looked like they’d been chawed.  Tom was in high
 10275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the
 10276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would
 10277	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkeep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to
 10278	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the
 10279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out
 10280	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he
 10281	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.
 10282	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10283	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
 10284	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in
 10285	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat’s
 10286	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a
 10287	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcorn-pone that was in Jim’s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how
 10288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most
 10289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmashed all his teeth out; and there warn’t ever anything could a worked
 10290	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only
 10291	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust a piece of rock or something like that that’s always getting into
 10292	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he
 10293	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.
 10294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
 10296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim’s bed; and they kept on
 10297	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpiling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn’t hardly room
 10298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to
 10299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoor!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches” once, and keeled
 10300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was
 10301	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim’s meat,
 10302	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back
 10303	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain and shut the door, and I knowed he’d fixed the other door too.
 10304	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and
 10305	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasking him if he’d been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,
 10306	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand blinked his eyes around, and says:
 10307	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10308	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mars Sid, you’ll say I’s a fool, but if I didn’t b’lieve I see most a
 10309	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmillion dogs, er devils, er some’n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese
 10310	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttracks.  I did, mos’ sholy.  Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey

 10314	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10315	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom says:
 10316	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10317	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I tell you what I think.  What makes them come here just at this
 10318	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trunaway nigger’s breakfast-time?  It’s because they’re hungry; that’s
 10319	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe reason.  You make them a witch pie; that’s the thing for _you_ to
 10320	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo.”
 10321	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10322	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But my lan’, Mars Sid, how’s I gwyne to make ‘m a witch pie?  I doan’

 10326	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10327	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Will you do it, honey?--will you?  I’ll wusshup de groun’ und’ yo’ foot,

 10345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHAT was all fixed.  So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile
 10347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces
 10348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched
 10349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as
 10350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full
 10351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails
 10352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and
 10353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt
 10354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSally’s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t’other we stuck
 10355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the band of Uncle Silas’s hat, which was on the bureau, because we
 10356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger’s
 10357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thouse this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the
 10358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpewter spoon in Uncle Silas’s coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn’t come
 10359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyet, so we had to wait a little while.
 10360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn’t hardly
 10362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one
 10363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand and cracking the handiest child’s head with her thimble with the
 10364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother, and says:
 10365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ve hunted high and I’ve hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_
 10367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecome of your other shirt.”
 10368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMy heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard
 10370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpiece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the
 10371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troad with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the
 10372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry
 10373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around
 10374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for
 10375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out
 10376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor half price if there was a bidder.  But after that we was all right
 10377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.
 10378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tUncle Silas he says:
 10379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s most uncommon curious, I can’t understand it.  I know perfectly
 10381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell I took it _off_, because--”
 10382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because you hain’t got but one _on_.  Just _listen_ at the man!  I know
 10384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering
 10385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmemory, too, because it was on the clo’s-line yesterday--I see it there
 10386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself. But it’s gone, that’s the long and the short of it, and you’ll
 10387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust have to change to a red flann’l one till I can get time to make a
 10388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnew one. And it ‘ll be the third I’ve made in two years.  It just keeps
 10389	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to
 10390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_do_ with ‘m all is more’n I can make out.  A body ‘d think you _would_
 10391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlearn to take some sort of care of ‘em at your time of life.”
 10392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.  But it oughtn’t to be
 10394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taltogether my fault, because, you know, I don’t see them nor have
 10395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to do with them except when they’re on me; and I don’t believe
 10396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ve ever lost one of them _off_ of me.”
 10397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it ain’t _your_ fault if you haven’t, Silas; you’d a done it
 10399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif you could, I reckon.  And the shirt ain’t all that’s gone, nuther.
 10400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Ther’s a spoon gone; and _that_ ain’t all.  There was ten, and now
 10401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tther’s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never
 10402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook the spoon, _that’s_ certain.”
 10403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, what else is gone, Sally?”
 10405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ther’s six _candles_ gone--that’s what.  The rats could a got the
 10407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don’t walk off with the
 10408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhole place, the way you’re always going to stop their holes and don’t
 10409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo it; and if they warn’t fools they’d sleep in your hair, Silas--_you’d_
 10410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever find it out; but you can’t lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I
 10411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow.”
 10412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Sally, I’m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I’ve been remiss; but
 10414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI won’t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.”
 10415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I wouldn’t hurry; next year ‘ll do.  Matilda Angelina Araminta
 10417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_Phelps!_”
 10418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the
 10420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsugar-bowl without fooling around any.  Just then the nigger woman steps
 10421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton to the passage, and says:
 10422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Missus, dey’s a sheet gone.”
 10424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A _sheet_ gone!  Well, for the land’s sake!”
 10426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll stop up them holes to-day,” says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.
 10428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, _do_ shet up!--s’pose the rats took the _sheet_?  _where’s_ it gone,
 10430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLize?”
 10431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Clah to goodness I hain’t no notion, Miss’ Sally.  She wuz on de

 10434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end.  I _never_ see the beat of it
 10436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin all my born days.  A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--”
 10437	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10438	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Missus,” comes a young yaller wench, “dey’s a brass cannelstick
 10439	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiss’n.”
 10440	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10441	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cler out from here, you hussy, er I’ll take a skillet to ye!”
 10442	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10443	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, she was just a-biling.  I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned
 10444	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.  She
 10445	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and
 10446	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking
 10447	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket.  She stopped,
 10448	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in
 10449	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:
 10450	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10451	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s _just_ as I expected.  So you had it in your pocket all the time;
 10452	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand like as not you’ve got the other things there, too.  How’d it get
 10453	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere?”
 10454	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10455	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reely don’t know, Sally,” he says, kind of apologizing, “or you know
 10456	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI would tell.  I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before
 10457	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put
 10458	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain’t in; but
 10459	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I’ll know I
 10460	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and
 10461	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook up the spoon, and--”
 10462	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10463	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, for the land’s sake!  Give a body a rest!  Go ‘long now, the whole
 10464	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkit and biling of ye; and don’t come nigh me again till I’ve got back my
 10465	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeace of mind.”
 10466	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10467	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’D a heard her if she’d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it
 10468	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout; and I’d a got up and obeyed her if I’d a been dead.  As we was
 10469	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpassing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the
 10470	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and
 10471	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.  Tom
 10472	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:
 10473	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10474	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it ain’t no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain’t
 10475	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treliable.” Then he says:  “But he done us a good turn with the spoon,
 10476	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway, without knowing it, and so we’ll go and do him one without _him_
 10477	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowing it--stop up his rat-holes.”
 10478	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10479	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole
 10480	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.  Then we heard
 10481	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes
 10482	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t’other,
 10483	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooking as absent-minded as year before last.  He went a mooning around,
 10484	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst to one rat-hole and then another, till he’d been to them all.
 10485	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle
 10486	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand thinking.  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,
 10487	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying:
 10488	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10489	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, for the life of me I can’t remember when I done it.  I could
 10490	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshow her now that I warn’t to blame on account of the rats.  But never
 10491	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind--let it go.  I reckon it wouldn’t do no good.”
 10492	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10493	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.  He was a
 10494	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty nice old man.  And always is.
 10495	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10496	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said
 10497	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe’d got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had ciphered it out
 10498	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the
 10499	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to
 10500	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcounting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of
 10501	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem up my sleeve, and Tom says:
 10502	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10503	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain’t but nine spoons _yet_.”
 10504	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10505	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe says:
 10506	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10507	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Go ‘long to your play, and don’t bother me.  I know better, I counted
 10508	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘m myself.”
 10509	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10510	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can’t make but nine.”
 10511	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10512	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody
 10513	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould.
 10514	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10515	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I declare to gracious ther’ _ain’t_ but nine!” she says.  “Why, what in
 10516	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe world--plague _take_ the things, I’ll count ‘m again.”
 10517	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10518	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she
 10519	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
 10520	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10521	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther’s _ten_ now!” and she looked huffy
 10522	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand bothered both.  But Tom says:
 10523	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10524	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Aunty, I don’t think there’s ten.”
 10525	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10526	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You numskull, didn’t you see me _count ‘m?_”
 10527	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10528	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know, but--”
 10529	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10530	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ll count ‘m _again_.”
 10531	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10532	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.
 10533	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so
 10534	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she’d start
 10535	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they
 10536	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed
 10537	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat
 10538	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgalley-west; and she said cle’r out and let her have some peace, and if
 10539	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she’d skin
 10540	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst
 10541	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along
 10542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with
 10543	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,
 10544	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause he said _now_ she couldn’t ever count them spoons twice alike
 10545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain to save her life; and wouldn’t believe she’d counted them right if
 10546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe _did_; and said that after she’d about counted her head off for the
 10547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnext three days he judged she’d give it up and offer to kill anybody
 10548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat wanted her to ever count them any more.
 10549	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10550	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of
 10551	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a
 10552	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of days till she didn’t know how many sheets she had any more,
 10553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand she didn’t _care_, and warn’t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her
 10554	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoul out about it, and wouldn’t count them again not to save her life;
 10555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe druther die first.
 10556	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10557	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon
 10558	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up
 10559	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcounting; and as to the candlestick, it warn’t no consequence, it would
 10560	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblow over by and by.
 10561	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10562	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We
 10563	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it
 10564	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
 10565	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and
 10566	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with
 10567	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe smoke; because, you see, we didn’t want nothing but a crust, and we
 10568	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course
 10569	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,
 10570	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore
 10571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long
 10572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person
 10573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith.  We let on it took nine months to make it.
 10574	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn’t go
 10576	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope
 10577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough for forty pies if we’d a wanted them, and plenty left over
 10578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a whole
 10579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdinner.
 10580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut we didn’t need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, and
 10582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso we throwed the rest away.  We didn’t cook none of the pies in the
 10583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble
 10584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged
 10585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from
 10586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEngland with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early
 10587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things
 10588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they
 10589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked
 10590	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first
 10591	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpies, because we didn’t know how, but she come up smiling on the last
 10592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone.  We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and
 10593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the
 10594	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long
 10595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a
 10596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would
 10597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope
 10598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tladder wouldn’t cramp him down to business I don’t know nothing what I’m
 10599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next
 10600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, too.
 10601	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10602	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNat didn’t look when we put the witch pie in Jim’s pan; and we put the
 10603	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim
 10604	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted
 10605	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,
 10606	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the
 10607	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twindow-hole.

 10613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim
 10615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tallowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.  That’s the
 10616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.  But he had to have
 10617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit; Tom said he’d _got_ to; there warn’t no case of a state prisoner not
 10618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.
 10619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford Dudley; look at old
 10621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNorthumberland!  Why, Huck, s’pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what
 10622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou going to do?--how you going to get around it?  Jim’s _got_ to do his
 10623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinscription and coat of arms.  They all do.”
 10624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim says:
 10626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coat o’ arm; I hain’t got nuffn but dish
 10628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”
 10629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, you don’t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.”
 10631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “Jim’s right, anyway, when he says he ain’t got no coat
 10633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof arms, because he hain’t.”
 10634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he’ll have one before
 10636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the goes out of this--because he’s going out _right_, and there ain’t
 10637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to be no flaws in his record.”
 10638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim
 10640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,
 10641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom set to work to think out the coat of arms.  By and by he said he’d
 10642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstruck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but there
 10643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas one which he reckoned he’d decide on.  He says:
 10644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire
 10646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under
 10647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a
 10648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the
 10649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger,
 10650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a
 10651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore
 10652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFretta, Minore Otto._  Got it out of a book--means the more haste the
 10653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tless speed.”
 10654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?”
 10656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says; “we got to dig in
 10658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike all git-out.”
 10659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s _some_ of it?  What’s a fess?”
 10661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A fess--a fess is--_you_ don’t need to know what a fess is.  I’ll show
 10663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim how to make it when he gets to it.”
 10664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person.  What’s a bar
 10666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsinister?”
 10667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I don’t know.  But he’s got to have it.  All the nobility does.”
 10669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat was just his way.  If it didn’t suit him to explain a thing to you,
 10671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the wouldn’t do it.  You might pump at him a week, it wouldn’t make no
 10672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifference.
 10673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to
 10675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfinish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a
 10676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done.  He
 10677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:
 10678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t1.  Here a captive heart busted. 2.  Here a poor prisoner, forsook by
 10680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.  Here a lonely
 10681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven
 10682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyears of solitary captivity. 4.  Here, homeless and friendless, after
 10683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,
 10684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnatural son of Louis XIV.
 10685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.
 10687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he got done he couldn’t no way make up his mind which one for Jim
 10688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed
 10689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would let him scrabble them all on.  Jim said it would take him a
 10690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyear to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he
 10691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block
 10692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem out for him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing to do but just
 10693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfollow the lines.  Then pretty soon he says:
 10694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t have log walls
 10696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.  We’ll fetch
 10697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta rock.”
 10698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him
 10700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever get out.
 10701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But Tom said he would let me help him do it.  Then he took a look to
 10702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee how me and Jim was getting along with the pens.  It was most pesky
 10703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttedious hard work and slow, and didn’t give my hands no show to get
 10704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell of the sores, and we didn’t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom
 10705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
 10706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know how to fix it.  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and
 10708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.
 10709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere’s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll smouch it,
 10710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,
 10711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo.”
 10712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt warn’t no slouch of an idea; and it warn’t no slouch of a grindstone
 10714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnuther; but we allowed we’d tackle it.  It warn’t quite midnight yet,
 10715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.  We smouched the
 10716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough
 10717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjob. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn’t keep her from falling
 10718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was
 10719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half
 10720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We
 10721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee it warn’t no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his
 10722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round
 10723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim
 10724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and
 10725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom superintended.  He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.  He
 10726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed how to do everything.
 10727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOur hole was pretty big, but it warn’t big enough to get the grindstone
 10729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.  Then Tom
 10730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmarked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,
 10731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
 10732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle
 10733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under
 10734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this straw tick and sleep on it.  Then we helped him fix his chain back
 10735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  But Tom thought of
 10736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething, and says:
 10737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You got any spiders in here, Jim?”
 10739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain’t, Mars Tom.”
 10741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, we’ll get you some.”
 10743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But bless you, honey, I doan’ _want_ none.  I’s afeard un um.  I jis’
 10745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘s soon have rattlesnakes aroun’.”
 10746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom thought a minute or two, and says:
 10748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a good idea.  And I reckon it’s been done.  It _must_ a been done;
 10750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit stands to reason.  Yes, it’s a prime good idea.  Where could you keep
 10751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit?”
 10752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Keep what, Mars Tom?”
 10754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, a rattlesnake.”
 10756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to
 10758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome in heah I’d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid
 10759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy head.”
 10760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Jim, you wouldn’t be afraid of it after a little.  You could tame

 10763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Tame_ it!”
 10765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--easy enough.  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,
 10767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they wouldn’t _think_ of hurting a person that pets them.  Any book
 10768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill tell you that.  You try--that’s all I ask; just try for two or three
 10769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdays. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he’ll love you;
 10770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand sleep with you; and won’t stay away from you a minute; and will let
 10771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.”
 10772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_’ talk so!  I can’t _stan_’ it!  He’d _let_

 10876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Tom was stumped.  But he studied it over, and then said Jim would
 10878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave to worry along the best he could with an onion.  He promised
 10879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim’s
 10880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would “jis’ ‘s soon have
 10881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it, and with the
 10882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twork and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and
 10883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpetting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of
 10884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,
 10885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to
 10886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all
 10887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpatience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier
 10888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for
 10889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them, and they was
 10890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust about wasted on him.  So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn’t
 10891	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.
 10892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

 10895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXIX.
 10897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
 10899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour
 10900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put
 10901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit in a safe place under Aunt Sally’s bed.  But while we was gone for
 10902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found
 10903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,
 10904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was
 10905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what
 10906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dusted
 10907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching
 10908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn’t
 10909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.
 10910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.
 10911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and
 10913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet’s
 10914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnest, but we didn’t.  The family was at home.  We didn’t give it right
 10915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we’d
 10916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttire them out or they’d got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then we
 10917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right
 10918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, but couldn’t set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes,
 10919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in
 10920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and
 10921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta rattling good honest day’s work:  and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!
 10922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t And there warn’t a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn’t
 10923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn’t
 10924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmatter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.  So
 10925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn’t no real
 10926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.  You’d see
 10927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they
 10928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgenerly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most
 10929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the time where you didn’t want them.  Well, they was handsome and
 10930	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstriped, and there warn’t no harm in a million of them; but that never
 10931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what
 10932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey might, and she couldn’t stand them no way you could fix it; and
 10933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery time one of them flopped down on her, it didn’t make no difference
 10934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.  I
 10935	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You
 10936	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And if
 10937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a
 10938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thowl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old
 10939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman so that he said he could most wish there hadn’t ever been no snakes
 10940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcreated.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the
 10941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thouse for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn’t over it yet; she warn’t
 10942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnear over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could
 10943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttouch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump
 10944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all
 10945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twomen was just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason or
 10946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother.
 10947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
 10949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tallowed these lickings warn’t nothing to what she would do if we ever
 10950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloaded up the place again with them.  I didn’t mind the lickings,
 10951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause they didn’t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we
 10952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other
 10953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim’s was when they’d
 10954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn’t like the spiders,
 10955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the spiders didn’t like Jim; and so they’d lay for him, and make it
 10956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes
 10957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the grindstone there warn’t no room in bed for him, skasely; and
 10958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen there was, a body couldn’t sleep, it was so lively, and it was
 10959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but
 10960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and
 10961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one
 10962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgang under him, in his way, and t’other gang having a circus over him,
 10963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at
 10964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn’t
 10965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.
 10966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.
 10968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he
 10969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;
 10970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
 10971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
 10972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all
 10973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to die, but didn’t.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever
 10974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee; and Tom said the same.
 10975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut as I was saying, we’d got all the work done now, at last; and we was
 10977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The old man had wrote
 10978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their
 10979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trunaway nigger, but hadn’t got no answer, because there warn’t no such
 10980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and
 10981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNew Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me
 10982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe cold shivers, and I see we hadn’t no time to lose. So Tom said, now
 10983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the nonnamous letters.
 10984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s them?”  I says.
 10986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it’s done one
 10988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, sometimes another.  But there’s always somebody spying around that
 10989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going
 10990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It’s a very good
 10991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We’ll use them both.  And it’s
 10992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tusual for the prisoner’s mother to change clothes with him, and she
 10993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstays in, and he slides out in her clothes.  We’ll do that, too.”
 10994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that
 10996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething’s up?  Let them find it out for themselves--it’s their
 10997	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlookout.”
 10998	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 10999	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I know; but you can’t depend on them.  It’s the way they’ve acted
 11000	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the very start--left us to do _everything_.  They’re so confiding
 11001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand mullet-headed they don’t take notice of nothing at all.  So if we
 11002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t _give_ them notice there won’t be nobody nor nothing to interfere
 11003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ‘ll go
 11004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff perfectly flat; won’t amount to nothing--won’t be nothing _to_ it.”
 11005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, as for me, Tom, that’s the way I’d like.”
 11007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:
 11009	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11010	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But I ain’t going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits
 11011	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme. What you going to do about the servant-girl?”
 11012	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11013	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’ll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that
 11014	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyaller girl’s frock.”
 11015	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11016	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Tom, that ‘ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she
 11017	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprob’bly hain’t got any but that one.”
 11018	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11019	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know; but you don’t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the
 11020	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.”
 11021	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11022	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, then, I’ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my
 11023	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\town togs.”
 11024	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11025	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You wouldn’t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?”
 11026	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11027	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, but there won’t be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.”
 11028	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11029	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That ain’t got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just
 11030	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or
 11031	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot. Hain’t you got no principle at all?”
 11032	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11033	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, I ain’t saying nothing; I’m the servant-girl.  Who’s Jim’s
 11034	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmother?”
 11035	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11036	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m his mother.  I’ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.”
 11037	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11038	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, you’ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.”
 11039	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11040	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Not much.  I’ll stuff Jim’s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed
 11041	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto represent his mother in disguise, and Jim ‘ll take the nigger woman’s
 11042	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgown off of me and wear it, and we’ll all evade together.  When a
 11043	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprisoner of style escapes it’s called an evasion.  It’s always called
 11044	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso when a king escapes, f’rinstance.  And the same with a king’s son;
 11045	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit don’t make no difference whether he’s a natural one or an unnatural
 11046	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone.”
 11047	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11048	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench’s
 11049	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the
 11050	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway Tom told me to.  It said:
 11051	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11052	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBeware.  Trouble is brewing.  Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_.
 11053	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11054	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and
 11055	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on
 11056	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe back door.  I never see a family in such a sweat.  They couldn’t a
 11057	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them
 11058	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.  If
 11059	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said “ouch!” if anything fell,
 11060	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe jumped and said “ouch!” if you happened to touch her, when she
 11061	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t noticing, she done the same; she couldn’t face noway and be
 11062	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every
 11063	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying “ouch,” and
 11064	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore she’d got two-thirds around she’d whirl back again, and say it
 11065	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn’t set up.  So the
 11066	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work
 11067	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.
 11068	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11069	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the
 11070	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstreak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we
 11071	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going
 11072	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the
 11073	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,
 11074	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.  This letter
 11075	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
 11076	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11077	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDon’t betray me, I wish to be your friend.  There is a desprate gang of
 11078	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway
 11079	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will
 11080	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstay in the house and not bother them.  I am one of the gang, but have
 11081	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and
 11082	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,
 11083	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the
 11084	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger’s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn
 11085	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as
 11086	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his
 11087	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your
 11088	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleasure.  Don’t do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do
 11089	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish
 11090	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tany reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._

 11094	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11095	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XL.
 11096	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11097	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went
 11098	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a
 11099	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,
 11100	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand found them in such a sweat and worry they didn’t know which end they
 11101	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
 11102	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsupper, and wouldn’t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a
 11103	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tword about the new letter, but didn’t need to, because we knowed as much
 11104	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her
 11105	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
 11106	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about
 11107	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally’s dress that he stole and
 11108	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas going to start with the lunch, but says:
 11109	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11110	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where’s the butter?”
 11111	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11112	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a corn-pone.”
 11113	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11114	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain’t here.”
 11115	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11116	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We can get along without it,” I says.
 11117	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11118	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We can get along _with_ it, too,” he says; “just you slide down cellar
 11119	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand fetch it.  And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come
 11120	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong. I’ll go and stuff the straw into Jim’s clothes to represent his
 11121	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as
 11122	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou get there.”
 11123	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11124	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as
 11125	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta person’s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of
 11126	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcorn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs
 11127	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes
 11128	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped
 11129	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:
 11130	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11131	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You been down cellar?”
 11132	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11133	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m.”
 11134	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11135	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What you been doing down there?”
 11136	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11137	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Noth’n.”
 11138	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11139	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Noth’n!_”
 11140	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11141	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m.”
 11142	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11143	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?”
 11144	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11145	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know ‘m.”
 11146	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11147	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You don’t _know_?  Don’t answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what
 11148	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou been _doing_ down there.”
 11149	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11150	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I
 11151	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave.”
 11152	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11153	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckoned she’d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I
 11154	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ts’pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
 11155	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout every little thing that warn’t yard-stick straight; so she says,
 11156	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery decided:
 11157	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11158	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.  You
 11159	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen up to something you no business to, and I lay I’ll find out what it
 11160	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis before I’M done with you.”
 11161	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11162	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.
 11163	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMy, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of them
 11164	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.
 11165	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,
 11166	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn’t;
 11167	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,
 11168	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
 11169	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn’t easy myself, but I
 11170	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t take my hat off, all the same.
 11171	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11172	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if
 11173	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we’d overdone this
 11174	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing, and what a thundering hornet’s-nest we’d got ourselves into, so
 11175	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before
 11176	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese rips got out of patience and come for us.
 11177	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11178	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAt last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn’t_ answer
 11179	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem straight, I didn’t know which end of me was up; because these men
 11180	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and
 11181	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn’t but a few minutes to
 11182	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the
 11183	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and
 11184	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was
 11185	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter
 11186	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty
 11187	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon, when one of them says, “I’M for going and getting in the cabin
 11188	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,” I most
 11189	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and
 11190	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:
 11191	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11192	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“For the land’s sake, what _is_ the matter with the child?  He’s got the
 11193	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrain-fever as shore as you’re born, and they’re oozing out!”
 11194	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11195	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes
 11196	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and
 11197	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thugged me, and says:
 11198	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11199	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it
 11200	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t no worse; for luck’s against us, and it never rains but it pours,
 11201	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when I see that truck I thought we’d lost you, for I knowed by
 11202	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,
 11203	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdear, whyd’nt you _tell_ me that was what you’d been down there for, I
 11204	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t a cared.  Now cler out to bed, and don’t lemme see no more of
 11205	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou till morning!”
 11206	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11207	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,
 11208	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I couldn’t hardly get my
 11209	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twords out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must
 11210	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,
 11211	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith guns!
 11212	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11213	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHis eyes just blazed; and he says:
 11214	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11215	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No!--is that so?  _ain’t_ it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was to do over
 11216	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could put it off till--”
 11217	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11218	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hurry!  _Hurry_!”  I says.  “Where’s Jim?”
 11219	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11220	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.
 11221	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He’s dressed, and everything’s ready.  Now we’ll slide out and give the

 11223	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11224	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them
 11225	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:
 11226	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11227	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I _told_ you we’d be too soon; they haven’t come--the door is locked.
 11228	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHere, I’ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for ‘em in the
 11229	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark and kill ‘em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,
 11230	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand listen if you can hear ‘em coming.”
 11231	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11232	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo in they come, but couldn’t see us in the dark, and most trod on
 11233	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all
 11234	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,
 11235	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Tom last, which was according to Tom’s orders.  Now we was in the
 11236	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door,
 11237	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn’t make
 11238	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
 11239	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out
 11240	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and
 11241	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlistened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all
 11242	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,
 11243	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy
 11244	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim
 11245	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover it; but Tom’s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top
 11246	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which
 11247	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks
 11248	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand started somebody sings out:
 11249	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11250	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’s that?  Answer, or I’ll shoot!”
 11251	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11252	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut we didn’t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there
 11253	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed
 11254	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround us! We heard them sing out:
 11255	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11256	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here they are!  They’ve broke for the river!  After ‘em, boys, and turn
 11257	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloose the dogs!”
 11258	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11259	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they wore
 11260	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboots and yelled, but we didn’t wear no boots and didn’t yell.  We was
 11261	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we
 11262	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind
 11263	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.  They’d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn’t scare off the
 11264	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trobbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they
 11265	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we
 11266	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn’t
 11267	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said
 11268	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thowdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and
 11269	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly
 11270	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was
 11271	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the
 11272	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver, but didn’t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we
 11273	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstruck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and
 11274	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the
 11275	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.  And when
 11276	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe stepped on to the raft I says:
 11277	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11278	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Now_, old Jim, you’re a free man again, and I bet you won’t ever be a
 11279	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslave no more.”
 11280	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11281	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It ‘uz planned beautiful, en
 11282	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit ‘uz done beautiful; en dey ain’t _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat’s mo’
 11283	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.”
 11284	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11285	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because
 11286	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the had a bullet in the calf of his leg.
 11287	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11288	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen me and Jim heard that we didn’t feel so brash as what we did
 11289	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in
 11290	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wigwam and tore up one of the duke’s shirts for to bandage him, but
 11291	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the says:
 11292	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11293	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don’t stop now; don’t fool around
 11294	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set
 11295	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther loose!  Boys, we done it elegant!--‘deed we did.  I wish _we’d_ a
 11296	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn’t a been no ‘Son of Saint

 11298	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta whooped him over the _border_--that’s what we’d a done with _him_--and
 11299	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  Man the sweeps--man the
 11300	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweeps!”
 11301	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11302	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut me and Jim was consulting--and thinking.  And after we’d thought a
 11303	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute, I says:
 11304	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11305	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say it, Jim.”
 11306	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11307	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he says:
 11308	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11309	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz _him_ dat ‘uz
 11310	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbein’ sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, ‘Go on
 11311	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ten save me, nemmine ‘bout a doctor f’r to save dis one?’  Is dat like
 11312	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You _bet_ he wouldn’t!  _well_,
 11313	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tden, is _Jim_ gywne to say it?  No, sah--I doan’ budge a step out’n dis
 11314	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace ‘dout a _doctor_, not if it’s forty year!”
 11315	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11316	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he’d say what he did say--so
 11317	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.
 11318	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and
 11319	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose
 11320	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself; but we wouldn’t let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind,
 11321	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut it didn’t do no good.
 11322	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11323	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:
 11324	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11325	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, if you’re bound to go, I’ll tell you the way to do when you
 11326	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
 11327	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse
 11328	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfull of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the
 11329	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the
 11330	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcanoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take
 11331	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this chalk away from him, and don’t give it back to him till you get him
 11332	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it
 11333	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain. It’s the way they all do.”
 11334	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11335	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he
 11336	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee the doctor coming till he was gone again.
 11337	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11338	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11339	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11340	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11341	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XLI.
 11342	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11343	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got
 11344	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting
 11345	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about
 11346	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and
 11347	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and
 11348	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to
 11349	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome home this evening and surprise the folks.
 11350	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11351	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who is your folks?” he says.
 11352	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11353	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The Phelpses, down yonder.”
 11354	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11355	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh,” he says.  And after a minute, he says:
 11356	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11357	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How’d you say he got shot?”
 11358	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11359	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He had a dream,” I says, “and it shot him.”
 11360	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11361	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Singular dream,” he says.
 11362	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11363	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But
 11364	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he sees the canoe he didn’t like the look of her--said she was big
 11365	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough for one, but didn’t look pretty safe for two.  I says:
 11366	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11367	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, you needn’t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy
 11368	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough.”
 11369	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11370	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What three?”
 11371	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11372	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that’s what I mean.”
 11373	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11374	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh,” he says.
 11375	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11376	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,
 11377	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand said he reckoned he’d look around for a bigger one.  But they was
 11378	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait
 11379	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better
 11380	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But
 11381	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI said I didn’t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he
 11382	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted.
 11383	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11384	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos’n he can’t fix
 11385	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat leg just in three shakes of a sheep’s tail, as the saying is?
 11386	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspos’n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--lay
 11387	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what
 11388	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_I’ll_ do.  I’ll wait, and when he comes back if he says he’s got to
 11389	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo any more I’ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we’ll take and tie
 11390	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom’s done
 11391	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith him we’ll give him what it’s worth, or all we got, and then let him
 11392	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget ashore.
 11393	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11394	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I
 11395	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and went for the
 11396	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoctor’s house, but they told me he’d gone away in the night some time
 11397	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor other, and warn’t back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad
 11398	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor Tom, and I’ll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,
 11399	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas’s
 11400	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstomach! He says:
 11401	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11402	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, _Tom!_  Where you been all this time, you rascal?”
 11403	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11404	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t been nowheres,” I says, “only just hunting for the runaway
 11405	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger--me and Sid.”
 11406	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11407	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, where ever did you go?” he says.  “Your aunt’s been mighty
 11408	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuneasy.”
 11409	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11410	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“She needn’t,” I says, “because we was all right.  We followed the men
 11411	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we
 11412	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and
 11413	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrossed over, but couldn’t find nothing of them; so we cruised along
 11414	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe
 11415	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we
 11416	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaddled over here to hear the news, and Sid’s at the post-office to see
 11417	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat he can hear, and I’m a-branching out to get something to eat for
 11418	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus, and then we’re going home.”
 11419	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11420	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo then we went to the post-office to get “Sid”; but just as I
 11421	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuspicioned, he warn’t there; so the old man he got a letter out of the
 11422	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toffice, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn’t come; so the old man
 11423	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done
 11424	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfooling around--but we would ride.  I couldn’t get him to let me stay
 11425	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand wait for Sid; and he said there warn’t no use in it, and I must come
 11426	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.
 11427	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11428	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and
 11429	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that
 11430	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t amount to shucks, and said she’d serve Sid the same when he come.
 11431	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11432	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd the place was plum full of farmers and farmers’ wives, to dinner;
 11433	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the
 11434	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworst; her tongue was a-going all the time.  She says:
 11435	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11436	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Sister Phelps, I’ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an’ I b’lieve

 11542	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold her the noise and shooting waked up me and “Sid,” and the door was

 11545	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more.  And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas
 11546	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore; and then she said she’d forgive us, and maybe it was all right
 11547	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys
 11548	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long

 11553	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon jumps up, and says:

 11555	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, lawsamercy, it’s most night, and Sid not come yet!  What _has_

 11568	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn’t run across Tom’s

 11571	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.  So she had
 11572	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be satisfied.  But she said she’d set up for him a while anyway, and
 11573	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkeep a light burning so he could see it.

 11575	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her

 11577	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI couldn’t look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked
 11578	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn’t
 11579	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every
 11580	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe
 11581	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or
 11582	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down
 11583	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsilent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home
 11584	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,
 11585	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her
 11586	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood, and she was in so much trouble.  And when she was going away she
 11587	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:
 11588	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11589	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The door ain’t going to be locked, Tom, and there’s the window and

 11592	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11593	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLaws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all

 11595	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11596	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.
 11597	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around
 11598	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfront, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her
 11599	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do
 11600	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething for her, but I couldn’t, only to swear that I wouldn’t never

 11609	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11610	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn’t get no
 11611	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrack of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying
 11612	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not
 11613	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teating anything. And by and by the old man says:
 11614	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11615	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did I give you the letter?”
 11616	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11617	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What letter?”
 11618	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11619	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.”
 11620	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11621	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, you didn’t give me no letter.”
 11622	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11623	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I must a forgot it.”
 11624	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11625	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had
 11626	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  She says:
 11627	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11628	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, it’s from St. Petersburg--it’s from Sis.”
 11629	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11630	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn’t stir.  But
 11631	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see
 11632	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old
 11633	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;
 11634	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a lot of people.  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come
 11635	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandy, and rushed.  She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:
 11636	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11637	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, he’s dead, he’s dead, I know he’s dead!”
 11638	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11639	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
 11640	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhich showed he warn’t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,
 11641	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
 11642	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11643	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He’s alive, thank God!  And that’s enough!” and she snatched a kiss of
 11644	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders
 11645	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue
 11646	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould go, every jump of the way.
 11647	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11648	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the
 11649	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.  The men
 11650	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to
 11651	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the other niggers around there, so they wouldn’t be trying to run
 11652	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a
 11653	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhole family scared most to death for days and nights.  But the others
 11654	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, don’t do it, it wouldn’t answer at all; he ain’t our nigger, and
 11655	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled
 11656	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem down a little, because the people that’s always the most anxious
 11657	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor to hang a nigger that hain’t done just right is always the very
 11658	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tones that ain’t the most anxious to pay for him when they’ve got their
 11659	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfaction out of him.
 11660	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11661	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the
 11662	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to
 11663	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes
 11664	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to
 11665	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and
 11666	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth legs, and said he warn’t to have nothing but bread and water to
 11667	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because
 11668	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the didn’t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and
 11669	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the
 11670	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and
 11671	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with
 11672	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and
 11673	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttakes a look, and says:
 11674	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11675	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t be no rougher on him than you’re obleeged to, because he ain’t
 11676	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bad nigger.  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn’t cut
 11677	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bullet out without some help, and he warn’t in no condition for
 11678	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little
 11679	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn’t let
 11680	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he’d kill
 11681	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn’t do
 11682	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and
 11683	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says
 11684	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course I
 11685	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had
 11686	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  It
 11687	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and
 11688	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof course I’d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t,
 11689	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause the nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yet
 11690	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stick
 11691	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a
 11692	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,
 11693	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been worked
 11694	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmain hard lately.  I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a
 11695	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too.  I
 11696	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he
 11697	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I
 11698	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_was_, with both of ‘m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about
 11699	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck
 11700	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped
 11701	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped
 11702	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was
 11703	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a
 11704	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and
 11705	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least
 11706	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trow nor said a word from the start.  He ain’t no bad nigger, gentlemen;
 11707	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s what I think about him.”
 11708	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11709	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSomebody says:
 11710	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11711	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I’m obleeged to say.”
 11712	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11713	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful
 11714	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was
 11715	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccording to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
 11716	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then they
 11717	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some
 11718	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right out
 11719	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand hearty, that they wouldn’t cuss him no more.
 11720	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11721	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he
 11722	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten
 11723	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they
 11724	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t think of it, and I reckoned it warn’t best for me to mix in, but
 11725	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged I’d get the doctor’s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as
 11726	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon as I’d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of
 11727	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot
 11728	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling
 11729	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround hunting the runaway nigger.
 11730	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11731	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day
 11732	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged
 11733	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.
 11734	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11735	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt
 11736	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSally was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room, and if I
 11737	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfound him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that
 11738	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and
 11739	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and
 11740	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding
 11741	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and
 11742	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful
 11743	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he’d been sleeping
 11744	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the
 11745	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, and ten to one he’d wake up in his right mind.
 11746	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11747	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his
 11748	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:
 11749	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11750	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello!--why, I’m at _home_!  How’s that?  Where’s the raft?”
 11751	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11752	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s all right,” I says.
 11753	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11754	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“And _Jim_?”
 11755	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11756	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The same,” I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash.  But he never
 11757	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnoticed, but says:
 11758	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11759	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good!  Splendid!  _Now_ we’re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”
 11760	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11761	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  “About what, Sid?”
 11762	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11763	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”
 11764	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11765	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What whole thing?”
 11766	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11767	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, _the_ whole thing.  There ain’t but one; how we set the runaway
 11768	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger free--me and Tom.”
 11769	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11770	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good land!  Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about!  Dear, dear,
 11771	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of his head again!”
 11772	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11773	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_No_, I ain’t out of my _head_; I know all what I’m talking about.  We
 11774	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_did_ set him free--me and Tom.  We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.
 11775	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t And we done it elegant, too.”  He’d got a start, and she never checked
 11776	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and
 11777	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see it warn’t no use for _me_ to put in.  “Why, Aunty, it cost us a
 11778	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpower of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was
 11779	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,
 11780	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the
 11781	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,
 11782	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand you can’t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and
 11783	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can’t think _half_ the
 11784	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfun it was.  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,
 11785	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the
 11786	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder
 11787	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work
 11788	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith in your apron pocket--”
 11789	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11790	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mercy sakes!”
 11791	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11792	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for
 11793	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that
 11794	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before
 11795	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let
 11796	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let
 11797	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us, but
 11798	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the
 11799	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by
 11800	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tourselves, and _wasn’t_ it bully, Aunty!”
 11801	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11802	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  So it was
 11803	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_you_, you little rapscallions, that’s been making all this trouble,
 11804	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand turned everybody’s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to
 11805	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeath.  I’ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out
 11806	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’ you this very minute.  To think, here I’ve been, night after night,
 11807	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I’ll tan the Old

 11809	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11810	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn’t_ hold in,
 11811	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all
 11812	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she
 11813	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
 11814	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11815	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I

 11817	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11818	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Meddling with _who_?”  Tom says, dropping his smile and looking
 11819	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsurprised.
 11820	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11821	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“With _who_?  Why, the runaway nigger, of course.  Who’d you reckon?”
 11822	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11823	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom looks at me very grave, and says:
 11824	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11825	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, didn’t you just tell me he was all right?  Hasn’t he got away?”
 11826	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11827	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Him_?” says Aunt Sally; “the runaway nigger?  ‘Deed he hasn’t.
 11828	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t They’ve got him back, safe and sound, and he’s in that cabin again,
 11829	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he’s claimed or

 11831	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11832	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening

 11837	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat walks this earth!”
 11838	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11839	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What _does_ the child mean?”
 11840	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11841	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don’t go, _I’ll_
 11842	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo. I’ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.  Old Miss
 11843	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWatson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to
 11844	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her

 11846	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11847	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was

 11849	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11850	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women!  Why,
 11851	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I’d a waded neck-deep in blood
 11852	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_”
 11853	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11854	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIf she warn’t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as
 11855	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!
 11856	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11857	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and
 11858	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,
 11859	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  And I peeped
 11860	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, and in a little while Tom’s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and
 11861	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding
 11862	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim into the earth, you know.  And then she says:
 11863	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11864	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, you _better_ turn y’r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.”
 11865	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11866	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally; “_Is_ he changed so?  Why, that ain’t
 11867	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_Tom_, it’s Sid; Tom’s--Tom’s--why, where is Tom?  He was here a minute
 11868	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tago.”
 11869	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11870	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You mean where’s Huck _Finn_--that’s what you mean!  I reckon I hain’t
 11871	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I
 11872	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_see_ him.  That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that
 11873	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed, Huck Finn.”
 11874	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11875	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I done it.  But not feeling brash.
 11876	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11877	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever
 11878	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told
 11879	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit all to him.  It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn’t
 11880	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting
 11881	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the
 11882	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toldest man in the world couldn’t a understood it.  So Tom’s Aunt Polly,
 11883	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how
 11884	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom
 11885	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer--she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I’m
 11886	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to it now, and ‘tain’t no need to change”--that when Aunt Sally took
 11887	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn’t no other way, and
 11888	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being
 11889	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta mystery, and he’d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly
 11890	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied.  And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made

 11892	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11893	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting
 11894	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took
 11895	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn’t
 11896	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_
 11897	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thelp a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.
 11898	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11899	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and
 11900	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:
 11901	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11902	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go off that
 11903	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go and trapse all
 11904	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that
 11905	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcreetur’s up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn’t seem to get any
 11906	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanswer out of you about it.”
 11907	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11908	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I never heard nothing from you,” says Aunt Sally.
 11909	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11910	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I wonder!  Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean
 11911	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby Sid being here.”
 11912	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11913	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I never got ‘em, Sis.”
 11914	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11915	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:
 11916	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11917	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You, Tom!”
 11918	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11919	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well--_what_?” he says, kind of pettish.
 11920	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11921	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.”
 11922	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11923	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What letters?”
 11924	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11925	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Them_ letters.  I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I’ll--”
 11926	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11927	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They’re in the trunk.  There, now.  And they’re just the same as they
 11928	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas when I got them out of the office.  I hain’t looked into them, I
 11929	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thain’t touched them.  But I knowed they’d make trouble, and I thought if

 11931	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11932	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain’t no mistake about it.  And I
 11933	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s’pose he--”
 11934	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11935	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, it come yesterday; I hain’t read it yet, but _it’s_ all right, I’ve

 11937	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11938	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn’t, but I reckoned maybe it
 11939	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas just as safe to not to.  So I never said nothing.
 11940	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11941	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11942	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11943	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11944	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER THE LAST
 11945	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11946	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time
 11947	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the evasion?--what it was he’d planned to do if the evasion worked all
 11948	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?
 11949	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got
 11950	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and
 11951	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about
 11952	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
 11953	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all
 11954	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
 11955	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprocession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would
 11956	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe.  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.
 11957	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11958	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
 11959	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSilas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,
 11960	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
 11961	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  And we had
 11962	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty
 11963	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,
 11964	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:
 11965	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11966	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson
 11967	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tislan’?  I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas’, en what’s de sign un it; en
 11968	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it’s
 11969	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome true; en heah she is!  _dah_, now! doan’ talk to _me_--signs is
 11970	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis’ ‘s well ‘at I ‘uz gwineter be
 11971	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trich agin as I’s a-stannin’ heah dis minute!”
 11972	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11973	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le’s all three
 11974	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
 11975	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thowling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a
 11976	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I
 11977	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn’t get
 11978	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnone from home, because it’s likely pap’s been back before now, and got
 11979	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.
 11980	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11981	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, he hain’t,” Tom says; “it’s all there yet--six thousand dollars
 11982	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand more; and your pap hain’t ever been back since.  Hadn’t when I come
 11983	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway, anyhow.”
 11984	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11985	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim says, kind of solemn:
 11986	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11987	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He ain’t a-comin’ back no mo’, Huck.”
 11988	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11989	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
 11990	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11991	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Jim?”
 11992	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11993	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain’t comin’ back no mo.”
 11994	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11995	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I kept at him; so at last he says:
 11996	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 11997	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Doan’ you ‘member de house dat was float’n down de river, en dey wuz a

 12001	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
 12002	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard
 12003	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain’t
 12004	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I’d
 12005	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn’t a tackled it,
 12006	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand ain’t a-going to no more.  But I reckon I got to light out for the
 12007	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTerritory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she’s going to adopt me
 12008	AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand sivilize me, and I can’t stand it.  I been there before.
