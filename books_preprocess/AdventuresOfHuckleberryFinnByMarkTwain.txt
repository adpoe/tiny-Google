AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit:  the Missouri negro

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER I.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYOU don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAdventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter.  That book was made
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhich he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPolly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom’s Aunt Polly, she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNow the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tround--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcommenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the matter with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbarrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjuice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead people.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttry to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it.  Here she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeing gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all right, because she done it herself.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHer sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe widow made her ease up.  I couldn’t stood it much longer.  Then for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tan hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay, “Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don’t you try to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehave?”  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm.  All I wanted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade up my mind I wouldn’t try for it.  But I never said so, because it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn’t think
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout that, because I wanted him and me to be together.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use.  I felt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcompany.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all shriveled up.  I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hadn’t no confidence.  You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta spider.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there.  That was good!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER II.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson’s big nigger,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnamed Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who dah?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetween us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright between my shoulders.  Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsleepy--if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I know what I’s gwyne to do:  I’s gwyne to set down here and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlisten tell I hears it agin.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy eyes.  But I dasn’t scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext I got to itching underneath.  I didn’t know how I was going to set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplaces now.  I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable again.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would slip
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the kitchen and get some more.  I didn’t want him to try.  I said Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmight wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso still and lonesome.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe house.  Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\topen and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim would happen in and say, “Hm!  What you know ‘bout witches?” and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcharm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn’t touch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand been rode by witches.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBen Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpart of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\topened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin blood.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tband, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tany boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkilled.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmust have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand be forgot forever.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSome thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit in. Then Ben Rogers says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ‘bout
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days.  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seen
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin these parts for a year or more.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWatson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, she’ll do.  That’s all right.  Huck can come in.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I made my mark on the paper.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t says Tom Sawyer.  “We ain’t burglars.  That ain’t no sort of style.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tare highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Must we always kill the people?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, certainly.  It’s best.  Some authorities think different, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmostly it’s considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ransomed?  What’s that?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know.  But that’s what they do.  I’ve seen it in books; and so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof course that’s what we’ve got to do.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, blame it all, we’ve _got_ to do it.  Don’t I tell you it’s in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbooks?  Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand get things all muddled up?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that’s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tare these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto them?--that’s the thing I want to get at.  Now, what do you reckon it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t know.  But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit means that we keep them till they’re dead.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, that’s something _like_.  That’ll answer.  Why couldn’t you said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat before?  We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbothersome lot they’ll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto get loose.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How you talk, Ben Rogers.  How can they get loose when there’s a guard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A guard!  Well, that _is_ good.  So somebody’s got to set up all night
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.  I think that’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey get here?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because it ain’t in the books so--that’s why.  Now, Ben Rogers, do you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to do things regular, or don’t you?--that’s the idea.  Don’t you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing to do?  Do you reckon _you_ can learn ‘em anything?  Not by a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeal. No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right.  I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow.  Say, do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe kill the women, too?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on.  Kill
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe women?  No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.  You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLittle Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to be a robber any more.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBen Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton Sunday, and that settled the thing.  They agreed to get together and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaptain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdog-tired.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER III.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccount of my clothes; but the widow she didn’t scold, but only cleaned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehave awhile if I could.  Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand prayed, but nothing come of it.  She told me to pray every day, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhatever I asked for I would get it.  But it warn’t so.  I tried it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOnce I got a fish-line, but no hooks.  It warn’t any good to me without
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thooks.  I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make it work.  By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttry for me, but she said I was a fool.  She never told me why, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make it out no way.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDeacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?  Why can’t the widow get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback her silver snuffbox that was stole?  Why can’t Miss Watson fat up?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNo, says I to my self, there ain’t nothing in it.  I went and told the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was “spiritual gifts.”  This was too many for me, but she told me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.  I went out in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tadvantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go.  Sometimes the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta body’s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand knock it all down again.  I judged I could see that there was two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tProvidences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow’s Providence, but if Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no help
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor him any more.  I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the widow’s if he wanted me, though I couldn’t make out how he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPap he hadn’t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me; I didn’t want to see him no more.  He used to always whale me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the woods most of the time when he was around.  Well, about this time
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople said.  They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike pap; but they couldn’t make nothing out of the face, because it had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen in the water so long it warn’t much like a face at all.  They said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was floating on his back in the water.  They took him and buried him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the bank.  But I warn’t comfortable long, because I happened to think
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof something.  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don’t float on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this back, but on his face.  So I knowed, then, that this warn’t pap, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta woman dressed up in a man’s clothes.  So I was uncomfortable again.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.  All
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe boys did.  We hadn’t robbed nobody, hadn’t killed any people, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly just pretended.  We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut we never hived any of them.  Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,” and we would go to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand marked.  But I couldn’t see no profit in it.  One time Tom sent a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t(which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmerchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand “sumter”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t mules, all loaded down with di’monds, and they didn’t have only a guard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, and kill the lot and scoop the things.  He said we must slick up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tour swords and guns, and get ready.  He never could go after even a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthough they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill you rotted, and then they warn’t worth a mouthful of ashes more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan what they was before.  I didn’t believe we could lick such a crowd
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.  But there warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn’t no camels nor no elephants.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat that.  We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tteacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I didn’t see no di’monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.  He said there was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand elephants and things.  I said, why couldn’t we see them, then?  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid if I warn’t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould know without asking.  He said it was all done by enchantment.  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmagicians.  Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why,” said he, “a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tare as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “s’pose we got some genies to help _us_--can’t we lick
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe other crowd then?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How you going to get them?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know.  How do _they_ get them?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmoke a-rolling, and everything they’re told to do they up and do it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t They don’t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother man.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who makes them tear around so?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.  They belong to whoever rubs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe lamp or the ring, and they’ve got to do whatever he says.  If he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds, and fill
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdaughter from China for you to marry, they’ve got to do it--and they’ve
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to do it before sun-up next morning, too.  And more:  they’ve got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunderstand.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says I, “I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe palace themselves ‘stead of fooling them away like that.  And what’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How you talk, Huck Finn.  Why, you’d _have_ to come when he rubbed it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhether you wanted to or not.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church?  All right, then;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI _would_ come; but I lay I’d make that man climb the highest tree there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in the country.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks, it ain’t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.  You don’t seem to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow anything, somehow--perfect saphead.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould see if there was anything in it.  I got an old tin lamp and an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tiron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno use, none of the genies come.  So then I judged that all that stuff
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas only just one of Tom Sawyer’s lies.  I reckoned he believed in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tA-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different.  It had all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe marks of a Sunday-school.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER IV.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrite just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes seven is thirty-five, and I don’t reckon I could ever get any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther than that if I was to live forever.  I don’t take no stock in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmathematics, anyway.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAt first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday done me good and cheered me up.  So the longer I went to school the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teasier it got to be.  I was getting sort of used to the widow’s ways,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo, and they warn’t so raspy on me.  Living in a house and sleeping in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trest to me.  I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnew ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsure, and doing very satisfactory.  She said she warn’t ashamed of me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand crossed me off. She says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta mess you are always making!”  The widow put in a good word for me, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat warn’t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn’t one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlow-spirited and on the watch-out.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the high board fence.  There was an inch of new snow on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tground, and I seen somebody’s tracks.  They had come up from the quarry
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfence.  It was funny they hadn’t come in, after standing around so.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make it out.  It was very curious, somehow.  I was going to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.  I didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice anything at first, but next I did.  There was a cross in the left
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was up in a second and shinning down the hill.  I looked over my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoulder every now and then, but I didn’t see nobody.  I was at Judge
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher’s as quick as I could get there.  He said:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.  Did you come for your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir,” I says; “is there some for me?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars.  Quite a fortune for you.  You had better let me invest it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong with your six thousand, because if you take it you’ll spend it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir,” I says, “I don’t want to spend it.  I don’t want it at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall--nor the six thousand, nuther.  I want you to take it; I want to give
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit to you--the six thousand and all.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked surprised.  He couldn’t seem to make it out.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, what can you mean, my boy?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says, “Don’t you ask me no questions about it, please.  You’ll take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--won’t you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’m puzzled.  Is something the matter?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Please take it,” says I, “and don’t ask me nothing--then I won’t have to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell no lies.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe studied a while, and then he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oho-o!  I think I see.  You want to _sell_ all your property to me--not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive it.  That’s the correct idea.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’  That means I have bought
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit of you and paid you for it.  Here’s a dollar for you.  Now you sign
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I signed it, and left.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Watson’s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmagic with it.  He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything.  So I went to him that night and told him pap was here
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, for I found his tracks in the snow.  What I wanted to know was,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat he was going to do, and was he going to stay?  Jim got out his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit on the floor.  It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But it warn’t no use; he said it wouldn’t talk. He said sometimes it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t talk without money.  I told him I had an old slick counterfeit
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquarter that warn’t no good because the brass showed through the silver
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little, and it wouldn’t pass nohow, even if the brass didn’t show,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery time.  (I reckoned I wouldn’t say nothing about the dollar I got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould take it, because maybe it wouldn’t know the difference.  Jim smelt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmorning you couldn’t see no brass, and it wouldn’t feel greasy no more,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain. This time he said the hair-ball was all right.  He said it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.  I says, go on.  So the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yo’ ole father doan’ know yit what he’s a-gwyne to do.  Sometimes he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspec he’ll go ‘way, en den agin he spec he’ll stay.  De bes’ way is to

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER V.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had shut the door to.  Then I turned around and there he was.  I used
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.  I reckoned I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso unexpected; but right away after I see I warn’t scared of him worth
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbothring about.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was most fifty, and he looked it.  His hair was long and tangled and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgreasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike he was behind vines.  It was all black, no gray; so was his long,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmixed-up whiskers.  There warn’t no color in his face, where his face
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed; it was white; not like another man’s white, but a white to make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta body sick, a white to make a body’s flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfish-belly white.  As for his clothes--just rags, that was all.  He had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone ankle resting on t’other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then.  His hat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta lid.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttilted back a little.  I set the candle down.  I noticed the window was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup; so he had clumb in by the shed.  He kept a-looking me all over.  By
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Starchy clothes--very.  You think you’re a good deal of a big-bug,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_don’t_ you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe I am, maybe I ain’t,” I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you give me none o’ your lip,” says he.  “You’ve put on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable many frills since I been away.  I’ll take you down a peg
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore I get done with you.  You’re educated, too, they say--can read and

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twars. When I’d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith his hand and knocked it across the house.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s so.  You can do it.  I had my doubts when you told me.  Now looky

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Ain’t_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though?  A bed; and bedclothes; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta look’n’-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own father
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard.  I never see such a son.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbet I’ll take some o’ these frills out o’ you before I’m done with you.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhy, there ain’t no end to your airs--they say you’re rich.  Hey?--how’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They lie--that’s how.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Looky here--mind how you talk to me; I’m a-standing about all I can
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstand now--so don’t gimme no sass.  I’ve been in town two days, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ rich.  I heard about it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway down the river, too.  That’s why I come.  You git me that money
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto-morrow--I want it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t got no money.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a lie.  Judge Thatcher’s got it.  You git it.  I want it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t got no money, I tell you.  You ask Judge Thatcher; he’ll tell
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou the same.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right.  I’ll ask him; and I’ll make him pungle, too, or I’ll know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe reason why.  Say, how much you got in your pocket?  I want it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t got only a dollar, and I want that to--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It don’t make no difference what you want it for--you just shell it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing down town to get some whisky; said he hadn’t had a drink all day.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme if I didn’t drop that.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher’s and bullyragged
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn’t, and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the swore he’d make the law force him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad just come, and he didn’t know the old man; so he said courts mustn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinterfere and separate families if they could help it; said he’d druther
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot take a child away from its father.  So Judge Thatcher and the widow
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad to quit on the business.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat pleased the old man till he couldn’t rest.  He said he’d cowhide
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme till I was black and blue if I didn’t raise some money for him.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tborrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim again for a week.  But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof his son, and he’d make it warm for _him_.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told pie to him, so to speak.  And after supper he talked to him about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttemperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he’d been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn’t be ashamed of, and he hoped the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudge would help him and not look down on him.  The judge said he could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he’d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudge said he believed it.  The old man said that what a man wanted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain.  And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere’s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no more; it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hand of a man that’s started in on a new life, and’ll die before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’ll go back.  You mark them words--don’t forget I said them.  It’s a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclean hand now; shake it--don’t be afeard.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudge’s wife she kissed it.  Then the old man he signed a pledge--made
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnew coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfroze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.  And when they come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnavigate it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe judge he felt kind of sore.  He said he reckoned a body could reform
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn’t know no other way.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER VI.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent for me, too, for not stopping school.  He catched me a couple of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim or outrun him most of the time.  I didn’t want to go to school much
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore, but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap.  That law trial was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslow business--appeared like they warn’t ever going to get started on it;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso every now and then I’d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.  Every time he got money he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery time he raised Cain he got jailed.  He was just suited--this kind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof thing was right in his line.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe got to hanging around the widow’s too much and so she told him at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast that if he didn’t quit using around there she would make trouble
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor him. Well, _wasn’t_ he mad?  He said he would show who was Huck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFinn’s boss.  So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcatched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou couldn’t find it if you didn’t know where it was.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkey under his head nights.  He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.  Every little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhile he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk and had a good time, and licked me.  The widow she found out where
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpap drove him off with the gun, and it warn’t long after that till I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand fishing, and no books nor study.  Two months or more run along, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn’t see how I’d ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to like it so well at the widow’s, where you had to wash, and eat on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime.  I didn’t want to go back no more.  I had stopped cussing, because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe widow didn’t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno objections.  It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall around.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut by and by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I couldn’t stand
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. I was all over welts.  He got to going away so much, too, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlocking me in.  Once he locked me in and was gone three days.  It was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdreadful lonesome.  I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn’t ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to get out any more.  I was scared.  I made up my mind I would fix
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup some way to leave there.  I had tried to get out of that cabin many
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta time, but I couldn’t find no way.  There warn’t a window to it big
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough for a dog to get through.  I couldn’t get up the chimbly; it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas too narrow.  The door was thick, solid oak slabs.  Pap was pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcareful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe time.  But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work.  There was an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tputting the candle out.  I got under the table and raised the blanket,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto let me through.  Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods.  I got rid of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon pap come in.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPap warn’t in a good humor--so he was his natural self.  He said he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown town, and everything was going wrong.  His lawyer said he reckoned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there’d be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tguardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  This shook me up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.  Then the old man
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tincluding a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the names
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright along with his cussing.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe said he would like to see the widow get me.  He said he would watch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsix or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped and they couldn’t find me.  That made me pretty uneasy again,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand till he got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat chance.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnewspapers for wadding, besides some tow.  I toted up a load, and went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.  I thought it all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake to the woods when I run away.  I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe widow couldn’t ever find me any more.  I judged I would saw out and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.  While
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarmed up, and went to ripping again.  He had been drunk over in town,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.  A body
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud.  Whenever his liquor
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s like.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHere’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away from him--a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all the expense of raising.  Yes, just as that man has got that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tson raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin’ for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him.  And they call
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_that_ govment!  That ain’t all, nuther.  The law backs that old Judge
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher up and helps him to keep me out o’ my property.  Here’s what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe law does:  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup’ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim go round in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. They call that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgovment!  A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I _told_ ‘em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face.  Lots of ‘em
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard me, and can tell what I said.  Says I, for two cents I’d leave the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblamed country and never come a-near it agin.  Them’s the very words.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trest of it goes down till it’s below my chin, and then it ain’t rightly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstove-pipe.  Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.  Why, looky here.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta white man.  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s got as fine
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsilver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.  And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat do you think?  They said he was a p’fessor in a college, and could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.  And that ain’t the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home.  Well, that let me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to?  It was ‘lection day,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere; but when they told me there was a State in this country where
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d let that nigger vote, I drawed out.  I says I’ll never vote agin.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Them’s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trot for all me--I’ll never vote agin as long as I live.  And to see the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn’t a give me the road if I hadn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoved him out o’ the way.  I says to the people, why ain’t this nigger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput up at auction and sold?--that’s what I want to know.  And what do you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon they said? Why, they said he couldn’t be sold till he’d been in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe State six months, and he hadn’t been there that long yet.  There,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow--that’s a specimen.  They call that a govment that can’t sell a free
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger till he’s been in the State six months.  Here’s a govment that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgovment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six whole months before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger, and--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttaking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbarked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe tub some, too, all along, here and there.  He hopped around the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleft foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.  But it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfairly made a body’s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything he had ever done previous.  He said so his own self afterwards.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor two drunks and one delirium tremens.  That was always his word.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe key, or saw myself out, one or t’other.  He drank and drank, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn’t run my way.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneasy.  He groaned and moaned and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrashed around this way and that for a long time.  At last I got so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawful scream and I was up.  There was pap looking wild, and skipping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround every which way and yelling about snakes.  He said they was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn’t see no snakes.  He started
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off! take him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff! he’s biting me on the neck!”  I never see a man look so wild in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying there was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and by, and laid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill a while, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseemed terrible still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traised up part way and listened, with his head to one side.  He says,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery low:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tramp--tramp--tramp; that’s the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they’re coming
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter me; but I won’t go.  Oh, they’re here! don’t touch me--don’t! hands
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff--they’re cold; let go.  Oh, let a poor devil alone!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear him through the blanket.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee me and went for me.  He chased me round and round the place with a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then I couldn’t come for him no more.  I begged, and told him I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcussed, and kept on chasing me up.  Once when I turned short and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he dozed off pretty soon.  By and by I got the old split-bottom chair
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgun.  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind it to wait for him to stir.  And how slow and still the time did
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrag along.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER VII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“GIT up!  What you ‘bout?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was.  It
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.  Pap was standing over me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooking sour and sick, too.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What you doin’ with this gun?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why didn’t you roust me out?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, all right.  Don’t stand there palavering all day, but out with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou and see if there’s a fish on the lines for breakfast.  I’ll be along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a minute.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.  I noticed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.  I reckoned I would have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat times now if I was over at the town.  The June rise used to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twood-yards and the sawmill.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor what the rise might fetch along.  Well, all at once here comes a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcanoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thigh like a duck.  I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.  I just expected
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traise up and laugh at him.  But it warn’t so this time.  It was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she’s worth ten dollars.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight yet, and as I was running
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twillows, I struck another idea:  I judged I’d hide her good, and then,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I’d go down the river
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trough time tramping on foot.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrawing a bead on a bird with his gun.  So he hadn’t seen anything.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line.  He abused
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was what made me so long.  I knowed he would see I was wet, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen he would be asking questions.  We got five catfish off the lines
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand went home.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee, all kinds of things might happen.  Well, I didn’t see no way for a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhile, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater, and he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear? That man warn’t here for no good.  I’d a shot him.  Next time you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troust me out, you hear?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying give me the very idea I wanted.  I says to myself, I can fix it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow so nobody won’t think of following me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout twelve o’clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style.  Nine logs was enough for one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I judged he wouldn’t come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlog again.  Before he was t’other side of the river I was out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmatches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn’t any, only the one out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout the gun, and now I was done.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat that place and didn’t quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot away and didn’t know it was sawed, you wouldn’t never notice
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn’t likely
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody would go fooling around there.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn’t left a track.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfollowed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfarms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttouches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiles away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river.  The meal
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twillows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrag the river for me.  And they’ll follow that meal track to the lake
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat killed me and took the things.  They won’t ever hunt the river for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything but my dead carcass. They’ll soon get tired of that, and won’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJackson’s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson’s Island’s the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI woke up I didn’t know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou know what I mean--I don’t know the words to put it in.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toars working in rowlocks when it’s a still night.  I peeped out through
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I couldn’t tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabreast of me I see there warn’t but one man in it.  Think’s I, maybe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s pap, though I warn’t expecting him.  He dropped below me with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcurrent, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toars.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnights now.  T’other one said _this_ warn’t one of the short ones, he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughed, but he didn’t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlet him alone.  The first fellow said he ‘lowed to tell it to his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas nearly three o’clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn’t wait more than
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I couldn’t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIsland, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstanding up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta steamboat without any lights.  There warn’t any signs of the bar at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe head--it was all under water now.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt didn’t take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlanded on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbranches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the outside.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmonstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toars, there! heave her head to stabboard!”  I heard that just as plain
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas if the man was by my side.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid down for a nap before breakfast.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER VIII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfreckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery friendly.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn’t want to get up and cook
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsound of “boom!” away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmatter now.  “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarcass come to the top.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a fire,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I’ll keep a lookout, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif any of them’s floating around after me I’ll give them a show.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchanged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave, and I warn’t disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was “baker’s bread”--what the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand done it.  So there ain’t no doubt but there is something in that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing--that is, there’s something in it when a body like the widow or the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tparson prays, but it don’t work for me, and I reckon it don’t work for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly just the right kind.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I’d have a chance
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclose, where the bread did.  When she’d got pretty well along down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe log forked I could peep through.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thope so, anyway.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem first-rate, but they couldn’t see me.  Then the captain sung out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged I was gone.  If they’d a had some bullets in, I reckon they’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn’t hurt, thanks to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn’t hear it no more.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas giving it up.  But they didn’t yet a while.  They turned around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tisland they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent home to the town.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder so the rain couldn’t get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsupper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere ain’t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t stay so, you soon get over it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstrawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trazberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould all come handy by and by, I judged.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfar from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn’t shot
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thome. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t hear
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t much sand
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling around.  So I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthousand things.  Well, I couldn’t stay up there forever; so at last I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIllinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices.  I got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn’t got far when I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear a man say:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeat out.  Let’s look around.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t sleep much.  I couldn’t, somehow, for thinking.  And every time
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can’t live this way; I’m
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-going to find out who it is that’s here on the island with me; I’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfind it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto listen.  But I hadn’t no luck somehow; I couldn’t seem to find the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclose enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff the blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim!  I bet I was glad to see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.  I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand puts his hands together and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Doan’ hurt me--don’t!  I hain’t ever done no harm to a ghos’.  I alwuz
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tliked dead people, en done all I could for ‘em.  You go en git in de
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver agin, whah you b’longs, en doan’ do nuffn to Ole Jim, ‘at ‘uz
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawluz yo’ fren’.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead.  I was ever so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tglad to see Jim.  I warn’t lonesome now.  I told him I warn’t afraid of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s good daylight.  Le’s get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttruck? But you got a gun, hain’t you?  Den we kin git sumfn better den
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstrawbries.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Strawberries and such truck,” I says.  “Is that what you live on?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I come heah de night arter you’s killed.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What, all that time?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--indeedy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah--nuffn else.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reck’n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on de

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Since the night I got killed.”

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No!  W’y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta gun.  Dat’s good.  Now you kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith his knife, and fried him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  By and by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ‘uz killed in dat shanty ef it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.  He said Tom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had.  Then I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute.  Then he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe I better not tell.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Jim?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, dey’s reasons.  But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould you, Huck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blamed if I would, Jim.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck.  I--_I run off_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Jim!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell--you know you said you wouldn’ tell,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I did.  I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to it.  Honest _injun_,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI will.  People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkeeping mum--but that don’t make no difference.  I ain’t a-going to tell,

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSome young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain.  He said it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame way when young birds done it.  I was going to catch some of them,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut Jim wouldn’t let me.  He said it was death.  He said his father laid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid his father would die, and he did.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdinner, because that would bring bad luck.  The same if you shook the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttable-cloth after sundown.  And he said if a man owned a beehive
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmorning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.  Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed all kinds of signs.  He said he knowed most everything.  I said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim if there warn’t any good-luck signs.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mighty few--an’ _dey_ ain’t no use to a body.  What you want to know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen good luck’s a-comin’ for?  Want to keep it off?”  And he said:  “Ef
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’s got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s agwyne
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ‘kase it’s so fur

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s de use to ax dat question?  Don’t you see I has?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, are you rich?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.  Wunst I had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted out.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you speculate in, Jim?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, fust I tackled stock.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What kind of stock?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, live stock--cattle, you know.  I put ten dollars in a cow.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock.  De cow up ‘n’ died on my

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So you lost the ten dollars.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.  You know that one-laigged nigger dat b’longs to old Misto

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER IX.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat I’d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twide.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thigh. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget wet?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsummer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toutside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfollow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you’d have a little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tglimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a second, and now you’d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Jim, this is nice,” I says.  “I wouldn’t want to be nowhere else but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you wouldn’t a ben here ‘f it hadn’t a ben for Jim.  You’d a ben
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn’ mos’ drownded, too;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdat you would, honey.  Chickens knows when it’s gwyne to rain, en so do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tde birds, chile.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twall of high bluffs.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbroken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccount of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe could a had pets enough if we’d wanted them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe didn’t show ourselves in daylight.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdaylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfloor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, you!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut it didn’t budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“De man ain’t asleep--he’s dead.  You hold still--I’ll go en see.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe went, and bent down and looked, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a dead man.  Yes, indeedy; naked, too.  He’s ben shot in de back.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reck’n he’s ben dead two er three days.  Come in, Huck, but doan’ look
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat his face--it’s too gashly.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the needn’t done it; I didn’t want to see him.  There was heaps of old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgreasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twomen’s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men’s clothing,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo.  We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.  There was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboy’s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbaby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood open, but there warn’t nothing left in them that was any account.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurry, and warn’t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmonstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t have no label
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn’t find
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe other one, though we hunted all around.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbroad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta half a mile doing it.  I crept up the dead water under the bank, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thadn’t no accidents and didn’t see nobody.  We got home all safe.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER X.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome to be killed, but Jim didn’t want to.  He said it would fetch bad
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tluck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha’nt us; he said a man
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat warn’t buried was more likely to go a-ha’nting around than one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was planted and comfortable.  That sounded pretty reasonable, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t say no more; but I couldn’t keep from studying over it and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe rummaged the clothes we’d got, and found eight dollars in silver
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.  Jim said he reckoned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe people in that house stole the coat, because if they’d a knowed the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney was there they wouldn’t a left it.  I said I reckoned they killed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, too; but Jim didn’t want to talk about that.  I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now you think it’s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith my hands.  Well, here’s your bad luck!  We’ve raked in all this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttruck and eight dollars besides.  I wish we could have some bad luck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike this every day, Jim.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never you mind, honey, never you mind.  Don’t you git too peart.  It’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-comin’.  Mind I tell you, it’s a-comin’.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt did come, too.  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.  Well, after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tridge, and got out of tobacco.  I went to the cavern to get some, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfound a rattlesnake in there.  I killed him, and curled him up on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot of Jim’s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there’d be some fun
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen Jim found him there.  Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe snake’s mate was there, and bit him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvarmint curled up and ready for another spring.  I laid him out in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecond with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap’s whisky-jug and begun to pour
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit down.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  That all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  Jim told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbody and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t going
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent to sucking at the jug again.  His foot swelled up pretty big, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhisky.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim was laid up for four days and nights.  Then the swelling was all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone and he was around again.  I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.  And he said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleft shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I’ve
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tedgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey say, but I didn’t see it.  Pap told me.  But anyway it all come of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooking at the moon that way, like a fool.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand there was a spool in it.  Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcatched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn’t ever seen
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta good fry.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstirring up some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfind out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmust go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell in them, only Jim said I didn’t walk like a girl; and he said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.  I took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice, and done better.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttied up and started along the bank.  There was a light burning in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle shanty that hadn’t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twho had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twindow.  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta candle that was on a pine table.  I didn’t know her face; she was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstranger, for you couldn’t start a face in that town that I didn’t know.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome; people might know my voice and find me out.  But if this woman had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn’t forget I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a girl.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XI.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“COME in,” says the woman, and I did.  She says:  “Take a cheer.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done it.  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What might your name be?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sarah Williams.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where ‘bouts do you live?  In this neighborhood?’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m.  In Hookerville, seven mile below.  I’ve walked all the way and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’m all tired out.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hungry, too, I reckon.  I’ll find you something.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m, I ain’t hungry.  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there at a farm; so I ain’t hungry no more.  It’s what makes me so late.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMy mother’s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell my uncle Abner Moore.  He lives at the upper end of the town, she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays.  I hain’t ever been here before.  Do you know him?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No; but I don’t know everybody yet.  I haven’t lived here quite two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tweeks. It’s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town.  You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter stay here all night.  Take off your bonnet.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” I says; “I’ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.  I ain’t afeared
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the dark.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe said she wouldn’t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she’d send him along with me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff they used to was, and how they didn’t know but they’d made a mistake
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmurder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who done it?  We’ve heard considerable about these goings on down in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHookerville, but we don’t know who ‘twas that killed Huck Finn.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people _here_ that’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike to know who killed him.  Some think old Finn done it himself.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--is that so?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Most everybody thought it at first.  He’ll never know how nigh he come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto getting lynched.  But before night they changed around and judged it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas done by a runaway nigger named Jim.”

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why _he_--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI stopped.  I reckoned I better keep still.  She run on, and never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnoticed I had put in at all:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.  So there’s a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treward out for him--three hundred dollars.  And there’s a reward out for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told Finn, too--two hundred dollars.  You see, he come to town the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmorning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with ‘em on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.  Before night they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.  Well, next day they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfound out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tten o’clock the night the murder was done.  So then they put it on him,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.  Well, he hain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till this thing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’d get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck’s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t People do say he warn’t any too good to do it.  Oh, he’s sly, I reckon.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t If he don’t come back for a year he’ll be all right.  You can’t prove
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’ll walk in Huck’s money as easy as nothing.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I reckon so, ‘m.  I don’t see nothing in the way of it.  Has
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody quit thinking the nigger done it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, no, not everybody.  A good many thinks he done it.  But they’ll get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, are they after him yet?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you’re innocent, ain’t you!  Does three hundred dollars lay
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround every day for people to pick up?  Some folks think the nigger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t far from here.  I’m one of them--but I hain’t talked it around.  A
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfew days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat island over yonder that they call Jackson’s Island.  Don’t anybody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlive there? says I. No, nobody, says they.  I didn’t say any more, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done some thinking.  I was pretty near certain I’d seen smoke over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto myself, like as not that nigger’s hiding over there; anyway, says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI, it’s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.  I hain’t seen any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmoke sence, so I reckon maybe he’s gone, if it was him; but husband’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing over to see--him and another man.  He was gone up the river; but he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had got so uneasy I couldn’t set still.  I had to do something with my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it.  When the woman
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand smiling a little.  I put down the needle and thread, and let on to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe interested--and I was, too--and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Three hundred dollars is a power of money.  I wish my mother could get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. Is your husband going over there to-night?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes.  He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboat and see if they could borrow another gun.  They’ll go over after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Couldn’t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.  And couldn’t the nigger see better, too?  After midnight he’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlikely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this camp fire all the better for the dark, if he’s got one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’t think of that.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn’t feel a bit
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable.  Pretty soon she says,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you say your name was, honey?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“M--Mary Williams.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSomehow it didn’t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.  I wished the woman would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow she says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes’m, I did.  Sarah Mary Williams.  Sarah’s my first name.  Some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that’s the way of it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t look up yet.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.  She was right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout the rats. You’d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem when she was alone, or they wouldn’t give her no peace.  She showed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith it generly, but she’d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ouch!” it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to try for the next one.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnose I let drive, and if he’d a stayed where he was he’d a been a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent on talking about her and her husband’s matters.  But she broke off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto say:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy legs together on it and she went on talking.  But only about a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand very pleasant, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Come, now, what’s your real name?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wh--what, mum?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s your real name?  Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn’t know hardly what to do.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Please to don’t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.  If I’m in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway here, I’ll--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, you won’t.  Set down and stay where you are.  I ain’t going to hurt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, and I ain’t going to tell on you, nuther.  You just tell me your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecret, and trust me.  I’ll keep it; and, what’s more, I’ll help
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou. So’ll my old man if you want him to.  You see, you’re a runaway
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘prentice, that’s all.  It ain’t anything.  There ain’t no harm in it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou’ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.  Bless you,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchild, I wouldn’t tell on you.  Tell me all about it now, that’s a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I said it wouldn’t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo back on her promise.  Then I told her my father and mother was dead,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn’t stand it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchance and stole some of his daughter’s old clothes and cleared out, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thome lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout for this town of Goshen.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Goshen, child?  This ain’t Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tten mile further up the river.  Who told you this was Goshen?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the woods for my regular sleep.  He told me when the roads forked I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmust take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain’t no matter now.  I got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be moving along.  I’ll fetch Goshen before daylight.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on a minute.  I’ll put you up a snack to eat.  You might want it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she put me up a snack, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, when a cow’s laying down, which end of her gets up first?  Answer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup prompt now--don’t stop to study over it.  Which end gets up first?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The hind end, mum.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, a horse?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The for’rard end, mum.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“North side.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir heads pointed the same direction?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The whole fifteen, mum.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country.  I thought maybe you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas trying to hocus me again.  What’s your real name, now?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“George Peters, mum.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, try to remember it, George.  Don’t forget and tell me it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tElexander before you go, and then get out by saying it’s George
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tElexander when I catch you.  And don’t go about women in that old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don’t hold the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpoke the thread at it; that’s the way a woman most always does, but a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman always does t’other way.  And when you throw at a rat or anything,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto one side, like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don’t clap them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.  Why, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe other things just to make certain.  Now trot along to your uncle,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I’ll do what I can
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto get you out of it.  Keep the river road all the way, and next time
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road’s a rocky one,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand your feet’ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went up-stream far enough to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake the head of the island, and then started across.  I took off the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsun-bonnet, for I didn’t want no blinders on then.  When I was about the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsound come faint over the water but clear--eleven.  When I struck the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta good fire there on a high and dry spot.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow, as hard as I could go.  I landed, and slopped through the timber
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand up the ridge and into the cavern.  There Jim laid, sound asleep on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe ground.  I roused him out and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Git up and hump yourself, Jim!  There ain’t a minute to lose.  They’re
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter us!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.  By
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn’t show a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle outside after that.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut if there was a boat around I couldn’t see it, for stars and shadows
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tword.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIT must a been close on to one o’clock when we got below the island at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshore; and it was well a boat didn’t come, for we hadn’t ever thought to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  It warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIf the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbuilt, and watched it all night for Jim to come.  Anyways, they stayed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfault of mine.  I played it as low down on them as I could.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn’t set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she’d fetch a dog.  Well, then, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, why couldn’t she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelieved they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, or else we wouldn’t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So I said I didn’t care what was the reason they didn’t get us as long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas they didn’t.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlayer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t always run the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchannel, but hunted easy water.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsolemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEvery night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspread of lights at two o’clock that still night.  There warn’t a sound
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere; everybody was asleep.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEvery night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at some little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvillage, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon or other
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn’t roosting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou get a chance, because if you don’t want him yourself you can easy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfind somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t ever forgot.  I never see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpap when he didn’t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay, anyway.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat kind.  Pap always said it warn’t no harm to borrow things if you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the list and say we wouldn’t borrow them any more--then he reckoned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit wouldn’t be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconcluded to drop crabapples and p’simmons.  We warn’t feeling just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit come out, too, because crabapples ain’t ever good, and the p’simmons
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t be ripe for two or three months yet.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor didn’t go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlived pretty high.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, “Hel-_lo_, Jim,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdistinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the flashes come.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was there.  So I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Le’s land on her, Jim.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I doan’ want to go fool’n ‘long er no wrack.  We’s doin’ blame’ well,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ten we better let blame’ well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdey’s a watchman on dat wrack.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain’t nothing to watch but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody’s going to resk
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?”  Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t say nothing to that, so he didn’t try.  “And besides,” I says,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“we might borrow something worth having out of the captain’s stateroom.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaptains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcare a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle in your pocket; I can’t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t. He’d call it an adventure--that’s what he’d call it; and he’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tland on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn’t he throw style
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto it?--wouldn’t he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you’d think it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas Christopher C’lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_was_ here.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn’t talk any more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade fast there.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlabboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfeet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark we couldn’t see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tend of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfront of the captain’s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem to hear low voices in yonder!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen I heard a voice wail out and say:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, please don’t, boys; I swear I won’t ever tell!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother voice said, pretty loud:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a lie, Jim Turner.  You’ve acted this way before.  You always want
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore’n your share of the truck, and you’ve always got it, too, because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve swore ‘t if you didn’t you’d tell.  But this time you’ve said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit jest one time too many.  You’re the meanest, treacherousest hound in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis country.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcuriosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn’t back out now,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand so I won’t either; I’m a-going to see what’s going on here.  So I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the dark till there warn’t but one stateroom betwixt me and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfloor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t This one kept pointing the pistol at the man’s head on the floor, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’d _like_ to!  And I orter, too--a mean skunk!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don’t, Bill;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hain’t ever goin’ to tell.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Deed you _ain’t!_  You never said no truer thing ‘n that, you bet
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou.” And once he said:  “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn’t got the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbest of him and tied him he’d a killed us both.  And what _for_?  Jist
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor noth’n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that’s what for.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.  Put
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_up_ that pistol, Bill.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBill says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t want to, Jake Packard.  I’m for killin’ him--and didn’t he kill
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told Hatfield jist the same way--and don’t he deserve it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But I don’t _want_ him killed, and I’ve got my reasons for it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bless yo’ heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I’ll never forgit you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong’s I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPackard didn’t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslanted so that I couldn’t make very good time; so to keep from getting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trun over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstateroom, he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here--come in here.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn’t see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they’d been having.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I was glad I didn’t drink whisky; but it wouldn’t made much difference
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway, because most of the time they couldn’t a treed me because I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn’t_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto kill Turner.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He’s said he’ll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both our shares
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto him _now_ it wouldn’t make no difference after the row and the way
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe’ve served him.  Shore’s you’re born, he’ll turn State’s evidence; now
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou hear _me_.  I’m for putting him out of his troubles.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t.  Well, then, that’s all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright.  Le’s go and do it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on a minute; I hain’t had my say yit.  You listen to me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s _got_ to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone. But what I say is this:  it ain’t good sense to go court’n around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter a halter if you can git at what you’re up to in some way that’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjist as good and at the same time don’t bring you into no resks.  Ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat so?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You bet it is.  But how you goin’ to manage it this time?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, my idea is this:  we’ll rustle around and gather up whatever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpickins we’ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe truck. Then we’ll wait.  Now I say it ain’t a-goin’ to be more’n two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thours befo’ this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe’ll be drownded, and won’t have nobody to blame for it but his own
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tself.  I reckon that’s a considerble sight better ‘n killin’ of him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you can git aroun’ it; it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t good sense, it ain’t good morals.  Ain’t I right?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I reck’n you are.  But s’pose she _don’t_ break up and wash off?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can’t we?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, then; come along.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoan, and I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick, Jim, it ain’t no time for fooling around and moaning; there’s a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgang of murderers in yonder, and if we don’t hunt up their boat and set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther drifting down the river so these fellows can’t get away from the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twreck there’s one of ‘em going to be in a bad fix.  But if we find their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboat we can put _all_ of ‘em in a bad fix--for the sheriff ‘ll get ‘em.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tQuick--hurry!  I’ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart at the raft, and--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, my lordy, lordy!  _raf’_?  Dey ain’ no raf’ no mo’; she done broke
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloose en gone I--en here we is!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XIII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a wreck with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch a gang as that!  But it warn’t no time to be sentimentering.  We’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  So we went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he didn’t believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we get left
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.  We struck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tedge of the skylight was in the water.  When we got pretty close to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  I could just barely
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee her.  I felt ever so thankful.  In another second I would a been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taboard of her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut he jerked it in again, and says:

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Heave that blame lantern out o’ sight, Bill!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset down.  It was Packard.  Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.  Packard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays, in a low voice:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All ready--shove off!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI couldn’t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But Bill
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on--‘d you go through him?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No.  Didn’t you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No.  So he’s got his share o’ the cash yet.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, won’t he suspicion what we’re up to?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe he won’t.  But we got to have it anyway. Come along.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they got out and went in.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecond I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.  I out with my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknife and cut the rope, and away we went!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe didn’t touch an oar, and we didn’t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreathe.  We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshow like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunderstand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now was the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad time to before.  I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmurderers, to be in such a fix.  I says to myself, there ain’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttelling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI like it?  So says I to Jim:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The first light we see we’ll land a hundred yards below it or above
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, in a place where it’s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen I’ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir time comes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand this time worse than ever.  The rain poured down, and never a light
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed along down the river,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatching for lights and watching for our raft.  After a long time the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\train let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade for it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  So I said I would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere on the wreck.  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand shoved for the light.  As I got down towards it three or four more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed--up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in above the shore
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlight, and laid on my oars and floated.  As I went by I see it was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.  I skimmed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this knees.  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcry.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, what’s up?  Don’t cry, bub.  What’s the trouble?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pap, and mam, and sis, and--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I broke down.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, dang it now, _don’t_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand this ‘n ‘ll come out all right.  What’s the matter with ‘em?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They’re--they’re--are you the watchman of the boat?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  “I’m the captain
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeck-hand; and sometimes I’m the freight and passengers.  I ain’t as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trich as old Jim Hornback, and I can’t be so blame’ generous and good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoes; but I’ve told him a many a time ‘t I wouldn’t trade places with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim; for, says I, a sailor’s life’s the life for me, and I’m derned if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_I’d_ live two mile out o’ town, where there ain’t nothing ever goin’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it.  Says I--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI broke in and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They’re in an awful peck of trouble, and--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Who_ is?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you’d take your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat and go up there--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Up where?  Where are they?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“On the wreck.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What wreck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, there ain’t but one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What, you don’t mean the Walter Scott?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good land! what are they doin’ _there_, for gracious sakes?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, they didn’t go there a-purpose.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet they didn’t!  Why, great goodness, there ain’t no chance for ‘em
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif they don’t git off mighty quick!  Why, how in the nation did they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever git into such a scrape?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Easy enough.  Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, Booth’s Landing--go on.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“She was a-visiting there at Booth’s Landing, and just in the edge of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto stay all night at her friend’s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdisremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wreck.  Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrading-scow, and it was so dark we didn’t notice the wreck till we was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBill Whipple--and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!--I most wish ‘t it had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen me, I do.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My George!  It’s the beatenest thing I ever struck.  And _then_ what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdid you all do?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, we hollered and took on, but it’s so wide there we couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake nobody hear.  So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Miss Hooker she said if I didn’t strike help sooner, come here and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thunt up her uncle, and he’d fix the thing.  I made the land about a mile
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething, but they said, ‘What, in such a night and such a current?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere ain’t no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.’  Now if you’ll go
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“By Jackson, I’d _like_ to, and, blame it, I don’t know but I will; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twho in the dingnation’s a-going’ to _pay_ for it?  Do you reckon your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpap--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why _that’s_ all right.  Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther uncle Hornback--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Great guns! is _he_ her uncle?  Looky here, you break for that light
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquarter of a mile out you’ll come to the tavern; tell ‘em to dart you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout to Jim Hornback’s, and he’ll foot the bill.  And don’t you fool
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround any, because he’ll want to know the news.  Tell him I’ll have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this niece all safe before he can get to town.  Hump yourself, now; I’m
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome woodboats; for I couldn’t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta done it.  I wished the widow knowed about it.  I judged she would be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tproud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther.  She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn’t much chance
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor anybody being alive in her.  I pulled all around her and hollered
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little, but there wasn’t any answer; all dead still.  I felt a little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould stand it I could.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twreck for Miss Hooker’s remainders, because the captain would know her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the river.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt did seem a powerful long time before Jim’s light showed up; and when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.  By the time I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstruck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin and slept like dead people.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XIV.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboxes of seegars.  We hadn’t ever been this rich before in neither of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tour lives.  The seegars was prime.  We laid off all the afternoon in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the didn’t want no more adventures.  He said that when I went in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttexas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe fixed; for if he didn’t get saved he would get drownded; and if he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdid get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure.  Well, he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, ‘stead
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof mister; and Jim’s eyes bugged out, and he was interested.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’ know dey was so many un um.  I hain’t hearn ‘bout none un um,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tskasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat’s in a

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Get?”  I says; “why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Ain’_ dat gay?  En what dey got to do, Huck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_They_ don’t do nothing!  Why, how you talk! They just set around.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No; is dat so?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Of course it is.  They just set around--except, maybe, when there’s a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twar; then they go to the war.  But other times they just lazy around; or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d’ you hear a noise?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe skipped out and looked; but it warn’t nothing but the flutter of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteamboat’s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” says I, “and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tparlyment; and if everybody don’t go just so he whacks their heads off.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut mostly they hang round the harem.”

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The place where he keeps his wives.  Don’t you know about the harem?

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XV.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter.  We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOhio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto tie to, for it wouldn’t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn’t anything
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut little saplings to tie to.  I passed the line around one of them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway she went.  I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscared I couldn’t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen there warn’t no raft in sight; you couldn’t see twenty yards.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand set her back a stroke.  But she didn’t come.  I was in such a hurry
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hadn’t untied her.  I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texcited my hands shook so I couldn’t hardly do anything with them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the towhead.  That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout into the solid white fog, and hadn’t no more idea which way I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing than a dead man.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThinks I, it won’t do to paddle; first I know I’ll run into the bank
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I whooped and listened.  Away down there somewheres I hears a small
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhoop, and up comes my spirits.  I went tearing after it, listening
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsharp to hear it again.  The next time it come I see I warn’t heading
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor it, but heading away to the right of it.  And the next time I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was flying around, this way and that and t’other, but it was going
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight ahead all the time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was making the trouble for me.  Well, I fought along, and directly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hears the whoop _behind_ me.  I was tangled good now.  That was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI throwed the paddle down.  I heard the whoop again; it was behind me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t look
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnatural nor sound natural in a fog.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn another second or two it was solid white and still again.  I set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdraw a breath while it thumped a hundred.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI just give up then.  I knowed what the matter was.  That cut bank
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas an island, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it.  It warn’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowhead that you could float by in ten minutes.  It had the big timber
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf a mile wide.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever think of that.  No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyourself how fast _you’re_ going, but you catch your breath and think,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy! how that snag’s tearing along.  If you think it ain’t dismal and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonce--you’ll see.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of towheads, for I had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchannel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was there because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat hung over the banks.  Well, I warn’t long loosing the whoops down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern.  You never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkeep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfaster than what I was.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear no sign of a whoop nowheres.  I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnag, maybe, and it was all up with him.  I was good and tired, so I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid down in the canoe and said I wouldn’t bother no more.  I didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn’t help it;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig bend stern first.  First I didn’t know where I was; I thought I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup dim out of last week.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby the stars.  I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn’t nothing but a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of sawlogs made fast together.  Then I see another speck, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchased that; then another, and this time I was right.  It was the raft.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbranches and dirt.  So she’d had a rough time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI made fast and laid down under Jim’s nose on the raft, and began to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?  Why didn’t you stir me up?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?  En you ain’ dead--you ain’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrownded--you’s back agin?  It’s too good for true, honey, it’s too good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o’ you.  No, you ain’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead! you’s back agin, ‘live en soun’, jis de same ole Huck--de same ole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck, thanks to goodness!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the matter with you, Jim?  You been a-drinking?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Drinkin’?  Has I ben a-drinkin’?  Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin’?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How does I talk wild?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_How_?  Why, hain’t you been talking about my coming back, and all that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstuff, as if I’d been gone away?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.  _Hain’t_ you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tben gone away?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gone away?  Why, what in the nation do you mean?  I hain’t been gone
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanywheres.  Where would I go to?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, looky here, boss, dey’s sumf’n wrong, dey is.  Is I _me_, or who
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I?  Now dat’s what I wants to know.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I think you’re here, plain enough, but I think you’re a

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I is, is I?  Well, you answer me dis:  Didn’t you tote out de line in

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the wuz? En didn’t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime en mos’ git drownded?  Now ain’ dat so, boss--ain’t it so?  You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanswer me dat.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, this is too many for me, Jim.  I hain’t seen no fog, nor no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tislands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.  I been setting here talking with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done the same.  You couldn’t a got drunk in that time, so of course
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve been dreaming.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn’t any of it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thappen.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But, Huck, it’s all jis’ as plain to me as--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It don’t make no difference how plain it is; there ain’t nothing in it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI know, because I’ve been here all the time.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim didn’t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover it.  Then he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, den, I reck’n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tde powerfullest dream I ever see.  En I hain’t ever had no dream b’fo’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdat’s tired me like dis one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, well, that’s all right, because a dream does tire a body like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything sometimes.  But this one was a staving dream; tell me all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it, Jim.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit happened, only he painted it up considerable.  Then he said he must
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart in and “‘terpret” it, because it was sent for a warning.  He said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe current was another man that would get us away from him.  The whoops
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttry hard to make out to understand them they’d just take us into bad
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tluck, ‘stead of keeping us out of it.  The lot of towheads was troubles
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfolks, but if we minded our business and didn’t talk back and aggravate
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclear river, which was the free States, and wouldn’t have no more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrouble.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas clearing up again now.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, well, that’s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,” I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays; “but what does _these_ things stand for?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.  You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould see them first-rate now.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain.  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain right away.  But when he did get the thing straightened around he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do dey stan’ for?  I’se gwyne to tell you.  When I got all wore
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout wid work, en wid de callin’ for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmos’ broke bekase you wuz los’, en I didn’ k’yer no’ mo’ what become
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ter me en de raf’.  En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ten soun’, de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot, I’s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin’ ‘bout wuz how you could

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tashamed.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying anything but that.  But that was enough.  It made me feel so mean
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn’t ever sorry for it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafterwards, neither.  I didn’t do him no more mean tricks, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t done that one if I’d a knowed it would make him feel that way.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVI.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmonstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.  She had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfour long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmen, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcamp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpower of style about her.  It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton such a craft as that.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth sides; you couldn’t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.  I said likely we wouldn’t, because I had heard say there warn’t but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a dozen houses there, and if they didn’t happen to have them lit
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too.  So the question
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCairo.  Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaited.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere warn’t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot pass it without seeing it.  He said he’d be mighty sure to see it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause he’d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.  Every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle while he jumps up and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dah she is?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut it warn’t.  It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown again, and went to watching, same as before.  Jim said it made him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.  Well, I can
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twho was to blame for it?  Why, _me_.  I couldn’t get that out of my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trest; I couldn’t stay still in one place.  It hadn’t ever come home to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme before, what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make out to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself that I warn’t to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trightful owner; but it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaddled ashore and told somebody.”  That was so--I couldn’t get around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat noway.  That was where it pinched.  Conscience says to me, “What
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright under your eyes and never say one single word?  What did that poor
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told woman do to you that you could treat her so mean?  Why, she tried to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlearn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe good to you every way she knowed how.  _That’s_ what she done.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfidgeting up and down past me.  We neither of us could keep still.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Every time he danced around and says, “Dah’s Cairo!” it went through me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiserableness.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself.  He was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo children, and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAb’litionist to go and steal them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt most froze me to hear such talk.  He wouldn’t ever dared to talk such
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk in his life before.  Just see what a difference it made in him the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute he judged he was about free.  It was according to the old saying,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an ell.”  Thinks I, this is what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes of my not thinking.  Here was this nigger, which I had as good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn’t even know; a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman that hadn’t ever done me no harm.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.  My
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto it, “Let up on me--it ain’t too late yet--I’ll paddle ashore at the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst light and tell.”  I felt easy and happy and light as a feather
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright off.  All my troubles was gone.  I went to looking out sharp for a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlight, and sort of singing to myself.  By and by one showed.  Jim sings
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We’s safe, Huck, we’s safe!  Jump up and crack yo’ heels!  Dat’s de
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood ole Cairo at las’, I jis knows it!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim.  It mightn’t be, you know.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en I’ll say, it’s all on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I couldn’t ever ben free ef it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thadn’ ben for Huck; Huck done it.  Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de _only_ fren’ ole Jim’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot now.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.  I went along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslow then, and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I started
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor whether I warn’t.  When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’ his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpromise to ole Jim.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I just felt sick.  But I says, I _got_ to do it--I can’t get _out_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it.  Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey stopped and I stopped.  One of them says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s that yonder?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A piece of a raft,” I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you belong on it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, sir.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Any men on it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Only one, sir.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the bend.  Is your man white or black?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t answer up prompt.  I tried to, but the words wouldn’t come. I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn’t man
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough--hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit.  I see I was weakening; so I just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive up trying, and up and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He’s white.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wish you would,” says I, “because it’s pap that’s there, and maybe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.  He’s sick--and so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis mam and Mary Ann.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, the devil! we’re in a hurry, boy.  But I s’pose we’ve got to.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Come, buckle to your paddle, and let’s get along.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.  When we had made a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstroke or two, I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pap’ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.  Everybody goes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can’t do it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby myself.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s infernal mean.  Odd, too.  Say, boy, what’s the matter
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith your father?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s the--a--the--well, it ain’t anything much.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey stopped pulling.  It warn’t but a mighty little ways to the raft
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow. One says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Boy, that’s a lie.  What _is_ the matter with your pap?  Answer up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsquare now, and it’ll be the better for you.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I will, sir, I will, honest--but don’t leave us, please.  It’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe--the--Gentlemen, if you’ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theadline, you won’t have to come a-near the raft--please do.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one.  They backed water.  “Keep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway, boy--keep to looard.  Confound it, I just expect the wind has
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblowed it to us.  Your pap’s got the small-pox, and you know it precious
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell.  Why didn’t you come out and say so?  Do you want to spread it all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I’ve told everybody before, and they just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent away and left us.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Poor devil, there’s something in that.  We are right down sorry for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, but we--well, hang it, we don’t want the small-pox, you see.  Look
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there, I’ll tell you what to do.  Don’t you try to land by yourself, or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ll smash everything to pieces.  You float along down about twenty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiles, and you’ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.  It
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour folks are all down with chills and fever.  Don’t be a fool again,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand let people guess what is the matter.  Now we’re trying to do you a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s a good boy.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t It wouldn’t do any good to land yonder where the light is--it’s only a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twood-yard. Say, I reckon your father’s poor, and I’m bound to say he’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin pretty hard luck.  Here, I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboard, and you get it when it floats by.  I feel mighty mean to leave
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou; but my kingdom! it won’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t you see?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here’s a twenty to put on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboard for me.  Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe all right.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye.  If you see any runaway niggers
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good-bye, sir,” says I; “I won’t let no runaway niggers get by me if I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan help it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn’t no use for me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto try to learn to do right; a body that don’t get _started_ right when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’s little ain’t got no show--when the pinch comes there ain’t nothing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.  Then I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s’pose you’d a done right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?  No, says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI, I’d feel bad--I’d feel just the same way I do now.  Well, then, says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI, what’s the use you learning to do right when it’s troublesome to do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright and ain’t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I was stuck.  I couldn’t answer that.  So I reckoned I wouldn’t bother
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went into the wigwam; Jim warn’t there.  I looked all around; he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t anywhere.  I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Jim!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here I is, Huck.  Is dey out o’ sight yit?  Don’t talk loud.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.  I told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim they were out of sight, so he come aboard.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was a-listenin’ to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto shove for sho’ if dey come aboard.  Den I was gwyne to swim to de
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traf’ agin when dey was gone.  But lawsy, how you did fool ‘em, Huck!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Dat _wuz_ de smartes’ dodge!  I tell you, chile, I’spec it save’ ole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim--ole Jim ain’t going to forgit you for dat, honey.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we talked about the money.  It was a pretty good raise--twenty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars apiece.  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tStates. He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go, but he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twished we was already there.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe raft good.  Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting all ready to quit rafting.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a left-hand bend.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went off in the canoe to ask about it.  Pretty soon I found a man out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.  I ranged up and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mister, is that town Cairo?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cairo? no.  You must be a blame’ fool.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What town is it, mister?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If you want to know, go and find out.  If you stay here botherin’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround me for about a half a minute longer you’ll get something you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t want.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI paddled to the raft.  Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was high ground, so I didn’t go.  No high ground about Cairo, Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid. I had forgot it.  We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclose to the left-hand bank.  I begun to suspicion something.  So did
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim.  I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Doan’ le’s talk about it, Huck.  Po’ niggers can’t have no luck.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawluz ‘spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn’t done wid its work.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wish I’d never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I’d never laid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes on it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t yo’ fault, Huck; you didn’ know.  Don’t you blame yo’self
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘bout it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was all up with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCairo.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe talked it all over.  It wouldn’t do to take to the shore; we couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn’t no way but to wait
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe didn’t say a word for a good while.  There warn’t anything to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay.  We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?  It would only
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta canoe to go back in.  We warn’t going to borrow it when there warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we shoved out after dark on the raft.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnybody that don’t believe yet that it’s foolishness to handle a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow if they read on and see what more it done for us.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeanest thing to fog.  You can’t tell the shape of the river, and you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould see it.  Up-stream boats didn’t generly come close to us; they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe could hear her pounding along, but we didn’t see her good till she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas close.  She aimed right for us.  Often they do that and try to see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’s mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttry and shave us; but she didn’t seem to be sheering off a bit.  She
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tengines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toverboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the raft.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.  I could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchurning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould hear her.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn’t get any answer;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstruck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  But I made out to see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbank. I couldn’t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead out, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Be done, boys!  Who’s there?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s me.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’s me?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“George Jackson, sir.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do you want?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t want nothing, sir.  I only want to go along by, but the dogs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t let me.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I warn’t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, you did, did you?  Strike a light there, somebody.  What did you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay your name was?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“George Jackson, sir.  I’m only a boy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look here, if you’re telling the truth you needn’t be afraid--nobody’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurt you.  But don’t try to budge; stand right where you are.  Rouse out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns.  George Jackson, is there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody with you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir, nobody.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe man sung out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain’t you got any sense?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPut it on the floor behind the front door.  Bob, if you and Tom are
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tready, take your places.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All ready.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir; I never heard of them.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that may be so, and it mayn’t.  Now, all ready.  Step forward,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGeorge Jackson.  And mind, don’t you hurry--come mighty slow.  If there’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he’ll be shot.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCome along now.  Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsqueeze in, d’ you hear?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t hurry; I couldn’t if I’d a wanted to.  I took one slow step at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta time and there warn’t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunbarring and unbolting.  I put my hand on the door and pushed it a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle and a little more till somebody said, “There, that’s enough--put
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour head in.” I done it, but I judged they would take it off.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme at them, for about a quarter of a minute:  Three big men with guns
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung women which I couldn’t see right well.  The old gentleman says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There; I reckon it’s all right.  Come in.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twindows--there warn’t none on the side.  They held the candle, and took a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood look at me, and all said, “Why, _he_ ain’t a Shepherdson--no, there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t any Shepherdson about him.”  Then the old man said he hoped I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t mind being searched for arms, because he didn’t mean no harm by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--it was only to make sure.  So he didn’t pry into my pockets, but only
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfelt outside with his hands, and said it was all right.  He told me to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlady says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing’s as wet as he can be; and don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou reckon it may be he’s hungry?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“True for you, Rachel--I forgot.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the old lady says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Betsy” (this was a nigger woman), “you fly around and get him something
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself.  Buck, take this little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof yours that’s dry.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBuck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthough he was a little bigger than me.  He hadn’t on anything but a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshirt, and he was very frowzy-headed.  He came in gaping and digging one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ain’t they no Shepherdsons around?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey said, no, ‘twas a false alarm.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” he says, “if they’d a ben some, I reckon I’d a got one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey all laughed, and Bob says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you’ve been so slow in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, nobody come after me, and it ain’t right I’m always kept down; I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t get no show.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “you’ll have show enough,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall in good time, don’t you fret about that.  Go ‘long with you now, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo as your mother told you.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troundabout and pants of his, and I put them on.  While I was at it he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent out.  I said I didn’t know; I hadn’t heard about it before, no way.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, guess,” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How’m I going to guess,” says I, “when I never heard tell of it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But you can guess, can’t you?  It’s just as easy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Which_ candle?”  I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, any candle,” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know where he was,” says I; “where was he?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, he was in the _dark_!  That’s where he was!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, blame it, it’s a riddle, don’t you see?  Say, how long are you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to stay here?  You got to stay always.  We can just have booming
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes--they don’t have no school now.  Do you own a dog?  I’ve got a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdog--and he’ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in.  Do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness?  You bet
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI don’t, but ma she makes me.  Confound these ole britches!  I reckon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d better put ‘em on, but I’d ruther not, it’s so warm.  Are you all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tready? All right.  Come along, old hoss.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad for me down there, and there ain’t nothing better that ever I’ve
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome across yet.  Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texcept the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.  The young women had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquilts around them, and their hair down their backs.  They all asked me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquestions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trun off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto hunt them and he warn’t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then there warn’t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took what there was left, because the farm didn’t belong to us, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI come to be here.  So they said I could have a home there as long as I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted it.  Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthink, and when Buck waked up I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Can you spell, Buck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet you can’t spell my name,” says I.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet you what you dare I can,” says he.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right,” says I, “go ahead.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says I, “you done it, but I didn’t think you could.  It ain’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnext, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.  I hadn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstyle.  It didn’t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttown. There warn’t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpendulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand fifty before she got tuckered out.  They wouldn’t took any money for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.  By one of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tparrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunderneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan real ones is, but they warn’t real because you could see where
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas, underneath.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim’s Progress, about a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman that left his family, it didn’t say why.  I read considerable in it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFriendship’s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tread the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay’s Speeches, and another was Dr.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGunn’s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown in the middle and busted, like an old basket.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDeclaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdaughters which was dead made her own self when she was only
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t  Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t  There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.”  These
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thaving a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmany arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPresbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd did young Stephen sicken,    And did young Stephen die? And did the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsad hearts thicken,    And did the mourners cry?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNo; such was not the fate of    Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thearts round him thickened,    ‘Twas not from sickness’ shots.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNo whooping-cough did rack his frame,    Nor measles drear with spots;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNot these impaired the sacred name    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDespised love struck not with woe    That head of curly knots, Nor
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstomach troubles laid him low,    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tO no. Then list with tearful eye,    Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdid from this cold world fly    By falling down a well.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey got him out and emptied him;    Alas it was too late; His spirit
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas gone for to sport aloft    In the realms of the good and great.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by and by.  Buck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid she could rattle off poetry like nothing.  She didn’t ever have to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstop to think.  He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfind anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother one, and go ahead. She warn’t particular; she could write about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEvery time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand with her “tribute” before he was cold.  She called them tributes.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tundertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person’s name, which was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhistler.  She warn’t ever the same after that; she never complained,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut she kinder pined away and did not live long.  Poor thing, many’s the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taggravating me and I had soured on her a little.  I liked all that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfamily, dead ones and all, and warn’t going to let anything come between
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talive, and it didn’t seem right that there warn’t nobody to make some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself, but I couldn’t seem to make it go somehow.  They kept Emmeline’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troom trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tliked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmostly.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.  There was a little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t and play “The Battle of Prague” on it.  The walls of all the rooms was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhitewashed on the outside.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday, and it was a cool, comfortable place.  Nothing couldn’t be better.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t And warn’t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVIII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCOL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud.  He was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconfidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn’t ever have to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again for a week.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set down again
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was mixed, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and _they_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twore broad Panama hats.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike her father.  She was beautiful.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEach person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too.  My nigger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having anybody do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tround about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdaytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandsome lot of quality, I tell you.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfamilies--mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They was as high-toned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfine horses.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming.  We was crossing the road.  Buck says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick!  Jump for the woods!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.  Pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his gun across his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young Harney Shepherdson.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard Buck’s gun go off at my ear, and Harney’s hat tumbled off from his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead.  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thid.  But we didn’t wait.  We started through the woods on a run.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods warn’t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn’t see.  We never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman’s eyes blazed a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute--‘twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown, and he says, kind of gentle:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn’t you step
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the road, my boy?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The Shepherdsons don’t, father.  They always take advantage.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.  The two young
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmen looked dark, but never said nothing.  Miss Sophia she turned pale,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut the color come back when she found the man warn’t hurt.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSoon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tourselves, I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I bet I did.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did he do to you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Him?  He never done nothing to me.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, nothing--only it’s on account of the feud.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s a feud?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, where was you raised?  Don’t you know what a feud is?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never heard of it before--tell me about it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother man, and kills him; then that other man’s brother kills _him_;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody’s killed off, and there ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more feud.  But it’s kind of slow, and takes a long time.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Has this one been going on long, Buck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I should _reckon_!  It started thirty year ago, or som’ers along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere.  There was trouble ‘bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course.  Anybody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon maybe--I don’t know.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, who done the shooting?  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Laws, how do I know?  It was so long ago.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t anybody know?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t know now what the row was about in the first place.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Has there been many killed, Buck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes; right smart chance of funerals.  But they don’t always kill.  Pa’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot a few buckshot in him; but he don’t mind it ‘cuz he don’t weigh
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch, anyway.  Bob’s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom’s been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurt once or twice.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes; we got one and they got one.  ‘Bout three months ago my cousin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t’other side
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the river, and didn’t have no weapon with him, which was blame’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after him with his gun in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and ‘stead of jumping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff and taking to the brush, Bud ‘lowed he could out-run him; so they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe time; so at last Bud seen it warn’t any use, so he stopped and faced
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman he rode up and shot him down.  But he didn’t git much chance to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon he _warn’t_ a coward.  Not by a blame’ sight.  There ain’t a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one.  And there ain’t no cowards
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamongst the Grangerfords either.  Why, that old man kep’ up his end in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout winner.  They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind a little woodpile, and kep’ his horse before him to stop the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGrangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of ‘em was dead, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother died the next day.  No, sir; if a body’s out hunting for cowards
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the don’t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey don’t breed any of that _kind_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpreforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.  Buck and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.  I went up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.  I found that sweet
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she’d forgot her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTestament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troad, and there warn’t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor there warn’t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin summer-time because it’s cool.  If you notice, most folks don’t go to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchurch only when they’ve got to; but a hog is different.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSays I to myself, something’s up; it ain’t natural for a girl to be in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle piece of paper with “HALF-PAST TWO” wrote on it with a pencil.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\transacked it, but couldn’t find anything else.  I couldn’t make anything
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.  She
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplay now.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-running, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mars Jawge, if you’ll come down into de swamp I’ll show you a whole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstack o’ water-moccasins.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThinks I, that’s mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  He oughter
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow a body don’t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem. What is he up to, anyway?  So I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right; trot ahead.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat piece
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah’s whah dey is.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’s seed ‘m befo’; I don’t k’yer to see ‘em no mo’.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.  I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim to see me again, but it warn’t.  He nearly cried he was so glad, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the warn’t surprised.  Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme yell every time, but dasn’t answer, because he didn’t want nobody to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.  Says he:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I got hurt a little, en couldn’t swim fas’, so I wuz a considable ways
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehine you towards de las’; when you landed I reck’ned I could ketch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup wid you on de lan’ ‘dout havin’ to shout at you, but when I see dat

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why didn’t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, ‘twarn’t no use to ‘sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn--but

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_What_ raft, Jim?”

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Our ole raf’.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You mean to say our old raft warn’t smashed all to flinders?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, she warn’t.  She was tore up a good deal--one en’ of her was; but

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?  No; some er de niggers

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI don’t want to talk much about the next day.  I reckon I’ll cut it

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo to sleep again when I noticed how still it was--didn’t seem to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody stirring.  That warn’t usual.  Next I noticed that Buck was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround; everything as still as a mouse.  Just the same outside.  Thinks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI, what does it mean?  Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took up the river road as hard as I could put.  By and by I begin to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thear guns a good ways off.  When I come in sight of the log store and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.  There was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteamboat landing; but they couldn’t come it.  Every time one of them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth ways.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.  They started
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle.  All
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trun.  They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.  They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnineteen years old.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.  As soon as they was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of sight I sung out to Buck and told him.  He didn’t know what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.  He was awful
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsurprised.  He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmen come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother--wouldn’t be gone long.  I wished I was out of that tree, but I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdasn’t come down.  Buck begun to cry and rip, and ‘lowed that him and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday yet.  He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor three of the enemy.  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tambush.  Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trelations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them.  I asked him what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.  He said they’d got across
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river and was safe.  I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton because he didn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thain’t ever heard anything like it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorses!  The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tswum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsinging out, “Kill them, kill them!”  It made me so sick I most fell out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the tree.  I ain’t a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme sick again if I was to do that.  I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat night to see such things.  I ain’t ever going to get shut of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem--lots of times I dream about them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrouble was still a-going on.  I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t ever happened.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpiece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand got away as quick as I could.  I cried a little when I was covering
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup Buck’s face, for he was mighty good to me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was just dark now.  I never went near the house, but struck through
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe woods and made for the swamp.  Jim warn’t on his island, so I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tred-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.  The raft was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone!  My souls, but I was scared!  I couldn’t get my breath for most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta minute. Then I raised a yell.  A voice not twenty-five foot from me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good lan’! is dat you, honey?  Doan’ make no noise.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was Jim’s voice--nothing ever sounded so good before.  I run along the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso glad to see me.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Laws bless you, chile, I ‘uz right down sho’ you’s dead agin.  Jack’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen heah; he say he reck’n you’s ben shot, kase you didn’ come home no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmo’; so I’s jes’ dis minute a startin’ de raf’ down towards de mouf er
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tde crick, so’s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead.  Lawsy, I’s mighty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tglad to git you back again, honey.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right--that’s mighty good; they won’t find me, and they’ll think
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ve been killed, and floated down the river--there’s something up there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ‘ll help them think so--so don’t you lose no time, Jim, but just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe middle of the Mississippi.  Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudged that we was free and safe once more.  I hadn’t had a bite to eat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsince yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand pork and cabbage and greens--there ain’t nothing in the world so good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen it’s cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood time.  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim to get away from the swamp.  We said there warn’t no home like a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft, after all.  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft don’t.  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XIX.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twillows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t’other side; you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstreak that there’s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlog-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t’other side of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrow a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause they’ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo get pretty rank; and next you’ve got the full day, and everything
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tA little smoke couldn’t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmaybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother side you couldn’t tell nothing about her only whether she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn’t be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchopping, because they’re most always doing it on a raft; you’d see the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taxe flash and come down--you don’t hear nothing; you see that axe go
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup again, and by the time it’s above the man’s head then you hear the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_k’chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttin pans so the steamboats wouldn’t run over them.  A scow or a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughing--heard them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it made
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern the dern fog.’”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck’s folks made
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t go much on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes, nohow.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt’s lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdiscuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tallowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave took too long to _make_ so many.  Jim said the moon could a _laid_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn’t say nothing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst it, because I’ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstreak down.  Jim allowed they’d got spoiled and was hove out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnest.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft a bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell how long, except maybe frogs or something.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmorning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn’t get some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tberries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim.  I was about to dig out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn’t been doing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-coming.  They wanted to jump right in, but I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you do it.  I don’t hear the dogs and horses yet; you’ve got time
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake to the water and wade down to me and get in--that’ll throw the dogs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff the scent.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfurther and further away all the time, we couldn’t hardly hear them at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the cottonwoods and was safe.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOne of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand very gray whiskers.  He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one.  He had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tan old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.  After
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas that these chaps didn’t know one another.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What got you into trouble?” says the baldhead to t’other chap.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will reveal it to you,

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.  My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tair of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdying about the same time.  The second son of the late duke seized the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttitles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored.  I am the lineal
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdescendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcompanionship of felons on a raft!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be much comforted; said if we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.  He said we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t or “Your Lordship”--and he wouldn’t mind it if we called him plain
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim he wanted done.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some o’ dis or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn’t have much to say, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround that duke.  He seemed to have something on his mind.  So, along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the afternoon, he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation sorry for you, but you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t the only person that’s had troubles like that.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No you ain’t.  You ain’t the only person that’s ben snaked down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrongfully out’n a high place.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Alas!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, you ain’t the only person that’s had a secret of his birth.”  And,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby jings, _he_ begins to cry.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold!  What do you mean?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of sobbing.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“To the bitter death!”  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says, “That secret of your being:  speak!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You are what?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin’ at this very moment
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSixteen and Marry Antonette.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You!  At your age!  No!  You mean you’re the late Charlemagne; you must
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese gray hairs and this premature balditude.  Yes, gentlemen, you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn’t know hardly what to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we’d got him with us, too.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_him_. But he said it warn’t no use, nothing but to be dead and done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teasier and better for a while if people treated him according to his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn’t set down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand doing this and that and t’other for him, and standing up till he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your bein’ sour?  It ‘ll only
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake things oncomfortable.  It ain’t my fault I warn’t born a duke,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit ain’t your fault you warn’t born a king--so what’s the use to worry?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Make the best o’ things the way you find ‘em, says I--that’s my motto.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here--plenty grub and an easy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlife--come, give us your hand, duke, and le’s all be friends.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  It took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt didn’t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  But I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it’s the best way;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen you don’t have no quarrels, and don’t get into no trouble.  If they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn’t no objections, ‘long as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would keep peace in the family; and it warn’t no use to tell Jim, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t tell him.  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave their own way.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XX.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcovered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trunning--was Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNo, they allowed he wouldn’t.  I had to account for things some way, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he ‘lowed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who’s got a little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty poor, and had some debts; so when he’d squared up there warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis piece of a raft; so we reckoned we’d go down to Orleans on it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Pa’s luck didn’t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyears old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tskiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta runaway nigger.  We don’t run daytimes no more now; nights they don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbother us.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to.  I’ll think the thing over--I’ll invent a plan that’ll fix it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe’ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don’t want to go by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat town yonder in daylight--it mightn’t be healthy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTowards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim’s,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhich was a corn-shuck tick; there’s always cobs around about in a shuck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmakes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn’t.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta corn-shuck bed warn’t just fitten for me to sleep on.  Your Grace ‘ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake the shuck bed yourself.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsubmit; ‘tis my fate.  I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to stand
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clock it come on to rain
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow till twelve, but I wouldn’t a turned in anyway if I’d had a bed,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause a body don’t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsecond or two there’d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta mile around, and you’d see the islands looking dusty through the rain,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut I hadn’t any clothes on, and didn’t mind.  We didn’t have no trouble
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat and miss them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the king
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn’t no show for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme; so I laid outside--I didn’t mind the rain, because it was warm, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe waves warn’t running so high now.  About two they come up again,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthough, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tregular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim a-laughing.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  Then they got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttired of it, and allowed they would “lay out a campaign,” as they called
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle printed bills and read them out loud.  One bill said, “The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcelebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” would “lecture on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tScience of Phrenology” at such and such a place, on the blank day of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblank, at ten cents admission, and “furnish charts of character at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwenty-five cents apiece.”  The duke said that was _him_.  In another
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbill he was the “world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYounger, of Drury Lane, London.”  In other bills he had a lot of other
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnames and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta “divining-rod,” “dissipating witch spells,” and so on.  By and by he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod the boards,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tRoyalty?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” says the king.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You shall, then, before you’re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,” says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke.  “The first good town we come to we’ll hire a hall and do the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHow does that strike you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee, I don’t know nothing about play-actin’, and hain’t ever seen much
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it.  I was too small when pap used to have ‘em at the palace.  Do you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon you can learn me?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Easy!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right.  I’m jist a-freezn’ for something fresh, anyway.  Le’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcommence right away.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But if Juliet’s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhiskers is goin’ to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, don’t you worry; these country jakes won’t ever think of that.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBesides, you know, you’ll be in costume, and that makes all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifference in the world; Juliet’s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore she goes to bed, and she’s got on her night-gown and her ruffled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeedyevil armor for Richard III. and t’other chap, and a long white
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking and told him to get his part by heart.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo, and see if he couldn’t strike something.  We was out of coffee, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got there there warn’t nobody stirring; streets empty, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunning
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn’t too young or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twoods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he’d go and work that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcamp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprinters all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe camp-meeting.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbranches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatermelons and green corn and such-like truck.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor legs. They didn’t have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome of the children didn’t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas courting on the sly.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpreach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twords out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat, shouting, “It’s the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit and live!”  And people would shout out, “Glory!--A-a-_men_!”  And so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, come to the mourners’ bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that’s worn and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t (_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so on.  You couldn’t make out what the preacher said any more, on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccount of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up everywheres in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIndian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoodness he’d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twithout a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twithout money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta pirate he would say to him, “Don’t you thank me, don’t you give me no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcredit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnatural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.  Then somebody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!”  Well,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let _him_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpass the hat around!”  Then everybody said it, the preacher too.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsix times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlive in their houses, and said they’d think it was an honor; but he said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn’t do no good, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbesides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twork on the pirates.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcollected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.  And then he had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twagon when he was starting home through the woods.  The king said,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake it all around, it laid over any day he’d ever put in in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmissionarying line.  He said it warn’t no use talking, heathens don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke was thinking _he’d_ been doing pretty well till the king come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto show up, but after that he didn’t think so so much.  He had set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprinting-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.  And he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad got in ten dollars’ worth of advertisements for the paper, which he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tusual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprice as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”--and he left that all set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and ready to print in the paper, and didn’t charge nothing for it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he’d done a pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsquare day’s work for it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he showed us another little job he’d printed and hadn’t charged
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot.  It said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the run away from St. Jacques’ plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim back he could have the reward and expenses.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the daytime if we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to.  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaptured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto get the reward.  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut it wouldn’t go well with the story of us being so poor.  Too much
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike jewelry.  Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas we say on the boards.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn’t be no trouble
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout running daytimes.  We judged we could make miles enough that night
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke’s work in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboom right along if we wanted to.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, does you reck’n we gwyne to run acrost any mo’ kings on dis
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrip?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” I says, “I reckon not.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” says he, “dat’s all right, den.  I doan’ mine one er two kings,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut dat’s enough.  Dis one’s powerful drunk, en de duke ain’ much
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad so much trouble, he’d forgot it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXI.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn’t tie up.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.  When he had got it pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood him and the duke begun to practice it together.  The duke had to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlearn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn’t bellow out _Romeo_!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet’s a dear sweet mere child of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta girl, you know, and she doesn’t bray like a jackass.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe raft was grand to see.  But by and by the king tripped and fell
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toverboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkinds of adventures they’d had in other times along the river.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter dinner the duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Capet, we’ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI guess we’ll add a little more to it.  We want a little something to

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s onkores, Bilgewater?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke told him, and then says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor’s hornpipe; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou--well, let me see--oh, I’ve got it--you can do Hamlet’s soliloquy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hamlet’s which?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hamlet’s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAh, it’s sublime, sublime!  Always fetches the house.  I haven’t got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit in the book--I’ve only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom memory.  I’ll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit back from recollection’s vaults.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsqueeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would sigh, and next he’d let on to drop a tear.  It was beautiful
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see him. By and by he got it.  He told us to give attention.  Then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tarms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t This is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the king:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTo be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinnocent sleep, Great nature’s second course, And makes us rather sling
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere’s the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, The law’s delay, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBreathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresolution, like the poor cat i’ the adage, Is sicklied o’er with care.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd all the clouds that lowered o’er our housetops, With this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tregard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. ‘Tis a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost uncommon lively place, for there warn’t nothing but sword-fighting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace for our show.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted; they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgardens around them, but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fences
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tClumbus’s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople driving them out.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll the stores was along one street.  They had white domestic awnings in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfront, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused considerable many cuss words.  There was as many as one loafer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof tobacco or scratch.  What a body was hearing amongst them all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime was:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gimme a chaw ‘v tobacker, Hank.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left.  Ask Bill.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnone. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchaw of tobacco of their own.  They get all their chawing by borrowing;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’ me a chaw, Jack, I jist this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”--which is a lie pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch everytime; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstranger, so he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_You_ give him a chaw, did you?  So did your sister’s cat’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrandmother. You pay me back the chaws you’ve awready borry’d off’n me,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLafe Buckner, then I’ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won’t charge
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou no back intrust, nuther.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, you did--‘bout six chaws.  You borry’d store tobacker and paid back
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger-head.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnatural leaf twisted.  When they borrow a chaw they don’t generly cut it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen it’s handed back, and says, sarcastic:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing else _but_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand two or three inches deep in _all_ the places.  The hogs loafed and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrunted around everywheres.  You’d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere folks had to walk around her, and she’d stretch out and shut her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thappy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you’d hear a loafer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsing out, “Hi!  _so_ boy! sick him, Tige!” and away the sow would go,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsquealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand look grateful for the noise.  Then they’d settle back again till
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was a dog fight.  There couldn’t anything wake them up all over,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tputting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad moved out of them.  The bank was caved away under one corner of some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tothers, and that corner was hanging over.  People lived in them yet, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaves in at a time.  Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand back, and back, because the river’s always gnawing at it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the wagons.  There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseen three fights.  By and by somebody sings out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk; here he comes, boys!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof Boggs.  One of them says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time.  If he’d a-chawed up all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe men he’s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he’d have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable ruputation now.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother one says, “I wisht old Boggs ‘d threaten me, ‘cuz then I’d know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI warn’t gwyne to die for a thousan’ year.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun, and singing out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cler the track, thar.  I’m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-gwyne to raise.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told, and had a very red face.  Everybody yelled at him and laughed at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he’d attend to them and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn’t wait now because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, “Meat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst, and spoon vittles to top off on.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe see me, and rode up and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Whar’d you come f’m, boy?  You prepared to die?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he rode on.  I was scared, but a man says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He don’t mean nothing; he’s always a-carryin’ on like that when he’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk.  He’s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk nor sober.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you’ve swindled.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou’re the houn’ I’m after, and I’m a-gwyne to have you, too!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing on.  By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty ca’m and slow--he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m tired of this, but I’ll endure it till one o’clock.  Till one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’clock, mind--no longer.  If you open your mouth against me only once
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafter that time you can’t travel so far but I will find you.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he turns and goes in.  The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstirred, and there warn’t no more laughing.  Boggs rode off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut he wouldn’t; they told him it would be one o’clock in about fifteen
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould lock him up and get him sober; but it warn’t no use--up the street
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomebody says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he’ll listen
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto her.  If anybody can persuade him, she can.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo somebody started on a run.  I walked down street a ways and stopped.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorse.  He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn’t hanging back any, but was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Boggs!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second I see a young
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgirl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tround to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“O Lord, don’t shoot!”  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That young
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgirl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfather, crying, and saying, “Oh, he’s killed him, he’s killed him!”  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshove them back and shouting, “Back, back! give him air, give him air!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tColonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround on his heels and walked off.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was about sixteen, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat had the places wouldn’t give them up, and folks behind them was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying all the time, “Say, now, you’ve looked enough, you fellows;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘tain’t right and ‘tain’t fair for you to stay thar all the time, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and everybody was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texcited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstretching their necks and listening.  One long, lanky man, with long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone place to t’other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, “Boggs!” and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bang!” staggered backwards, says “Bang!” again, and fell down flat on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid it was just exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdozen people got out their bottles and treated him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.  In about a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHEY swarmed up towards Sherburn’s house, a-whooping and raging like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tInjuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe road was full of women’s heads, and there was nigger boys in every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treach.  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost to death.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey swarmed up in front of Sherburn’s palings as thick as they could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjam together, and you couldn’t hear yourself think for the noise.  It
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out “Tear down the fence! tear
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the fence!”  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troll in like a wave.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJust then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tca’m and deliberate, not saying a word.  The racket stopped, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twave sucked back.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.  Sherburn run his eye slow
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout-gaze him, but they couldn’t; they dropped their eyes and looked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s got sand in it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he says, slow and scornful:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The idea of _you_ lynching anybody!  It’s amusing.  The idea of you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_!  Because you’re brave
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_man_?  Why, a _man’s_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong as it’s daytime and you’re not behind him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do I know you?  I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSouth, and I’ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe average man’s a coward.  In the North he lets anybody walk over him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the daytime, and robbed the lot.  Your newspapers call you a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrave people so much that you think you are braver than any other
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople--whereas you’re just _as_ brave, and no braver.  Why don’t your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjuries hang murderers?  Because they’re afraid the man’s friends will
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoot them in the back, in the dark--and it’s just what they _would_ do.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.  Your mistake
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis, that you didn’t bring a man with you; that’s one mistake, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch your masks.  You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn’t had him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto start you, you’d a taken it out in blowing.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You didn’t want to come.  The average man don’t like trouble and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdanger. _You_ don’t like trouble and danger.  But if only _half_ a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts ‘Lynch him! lynch him!’ you’re
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafraid to back down--afraid you’ll be found out to be what you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tare--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf-a-man’s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings you’re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat an army is--a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tofficers.  But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpitifulness.  Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo home and crawl in a hole.  If any real lynching’s going to be done it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along.  Now _leave_--and take your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf-a-man with you”--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit when he says this.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttolerable cheap.  I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn’t want to.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent by, and then dived in under the tent.  I had my twenty-dollar gold
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpiece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere ain’t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thome and amongst strangers that way.  You can’t be too careful.  I ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\topposed to spending money on circuses when there ain’t no other way, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere ain’t no use in _wasting_ it on them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a real bully circus.  It was the splendidest sight that ever was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgraceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery lady’s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand she looking like the most loveliest parasol.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this whip and shouting “Hi!--hi!” and the clown cracking jokes behind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe horses did lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent just about wild.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tringmaster couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t noway understand. Why, I couldn’t a thought of them in a year.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They argued
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbenches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout!” and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn’t be no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdisturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn’t make no more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tround and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then t’other one on t’other side, and the people just crazy.  It
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas if he warn’t ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tastonishment.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.  Why, it was one of his own
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmen!  He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta been in that ringmaster’s place, not for a thousand dollars.  I don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn’t only about twelve
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople there--just enough to pay expenses.  And they laughed all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe show was over, but one boy which was asleep.  So the duke said these
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tArkansaw lunkheads couldn’t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned.  He said he could size their style.  So next morning he got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  The bills said:

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXIII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas jam full of men in no time.  When the place couldn’t hold no more,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEdmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand at last when he’d got everybody’s expectations up high enough, he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trainbow.  And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsucceeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tobleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTwenty people sings out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What, is it over?  Is that _all_?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says yes.  Then there was a fine time.  Everybody sings
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, “Sold!” and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttragedians.  But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on!  Just a word, gentlemen.”  They stopped to listen.  “We are
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsold--mighty badly sold.  But we don’t want to be the laughing stock of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas we live.  _No_.  What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town!  Then we’ll all be in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame boat.  Ain’t that sensible?” (“You bet it is!--the jedge is right!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t everybody sings out.) “All right, then--not a word about any sell.  Go
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext day you couldn’t hear nothing around that town but how splendid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat show was.  House was jammed again that night, and we sold this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrowd the same way.  When me and the king and the duke got home to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe third night the house was crammed again--and they warn’t new-comers
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis time, but people that was at the show the other two nights.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.  I smelt sickly eggs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsigns of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof them went in.  I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me; I couldn’t stand it.  Well, when the place couldn’t hold no more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft like the dickens was after you!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done it, and he done the same.  We struck the raft at the same time,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tword. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taudience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wigwam, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, how’d the old thing pan out this time, duke?”  He hadn’t been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup-town at all.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughed their bones loose over the way they’d served them people.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Greenhorns, flatheads!  I knew the first house would keep mum and let
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they’d lay for us the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthird night, and consider it was _their_ turn now.  Well, it _is_ their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturn, and I’d give something to know how much they’d take for it.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_would_ just like to know how they’re putting in their opportunity.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprovisions.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree nights.  I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore.  By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t it s’prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” I says, “it don’t.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why don’t it, Huck?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it don’t, because it’s in the breed.  I reckon they’re all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talike.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But, Huck, dese kings o’ ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat’s jist what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdey is; dey’s reglar rapscallions.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s what I’m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfur as I can make out.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is dat so?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You read about them once--you’ll see.  Look at Henry the Eight; this ‘n
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘s a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_.  And look at Charles Second,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSecond, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.  My,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He _was_ a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnext morning.  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tordering up eggs.  ‘Fetch up Nell Gwynn,’ he says.  They fetch her up.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext morning, ‘Chop off her head!’  And they chop it off.  ‘Fetch up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJane Shore,’ he says; and up she comes, Next morning, ‘Chop off her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead’--and they chop it off.  ‘Ring up Fair Rosamun.’  Fair Rosamun
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanswers the bell.  Next morning, ‘Chop off her head.’  And he made every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbook, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcase.  You don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof ourn is one of the cleanest I’ve struck in history.  Well, Henry he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttakes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoes he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show?  No.  All of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on.  That was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_his_ style--he never give anybody a chance.  He had suspicions of his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfather, the Duke of Wellington.  Well, what did he do?  Ask him to show
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup?  No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.  S’pose people
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleft money laying around where he was--what did he do?  He collared it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t S’pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown there and see that he done it--what did he do?  He always done the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother thing. S’pose he opened his mouth--what then?  If he didn’t shut it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup powerful quick he’d lose a lie every time.  That’s the kind of a bug
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHenry was; and if we’d a had him along ‘stead of our kings he’d a fooled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat town a heap worse than ourn done.  I don’t say that ourn is lambs,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause they ain’t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway.  All I say is, kings is kings,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand you got to make allowances.  Take them all around, they’re a mighty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tornery lot. It’s the way they’re raised.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, they all do, Jim.  We can’t help the way a king smells; history
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t tell no way.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now de duke, he’s a tolerble likely man in some ways.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, a duke’s different.  But not very different.  This one’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta middling hard lot for a duke.  When he’s drunk there ain’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnear-sighted man could tell him from a king.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, anyways, I doan’ hanker for no mo’ un um, Huck.  Dese is all I

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s the way I feel, too, Jim.  But we’ve got them on our hands, and we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to remember what they are, and make allowances.  Sometimes I wish we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould hear of a country that’s out of kings.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhat was the use to tell Jim these warn’t real kings and dukes?  It
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said:  you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t tell them from the real kind.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went to sleep, and Jim didn’t call me when it was my turn.  He often
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone that.  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t take notice nor let on.  I knowed what it was about.  He was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand homesick; because he hadn’t ever been away from home before in his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlife; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfolks does for their’n.  It don’t seem natural, but I reckon it’s so.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas asleep, and saying, “Po’ little ‘Lizabeth! po’ little Johnny! it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty hard; I spec’ I ain’t ever gwyne to see you no mo’, no mo’!”  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a mighty good nigger, Jim was.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tones; and by and by he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What makes me feel so bad dis time ‘uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXIV.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a few
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runaway
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim up in King Lear’s outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhite horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdull, solid blue, like a man that’s been drownded nine days.  Blamed if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the warn’t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand wrote out a sign on a shingle so:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfree and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn’t only look like he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead, he looked considerable more than that.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThese rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso much money in it, but they judged it wouldn’t be safe, because maybe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn’t hit no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tproject that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn’t put up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover to t’other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his’n
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he’d take off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand good and pious that you’d say he had walked right out of the ark,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof hours, taking on freight.  Says the king:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Seein’ how I’m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLouis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.  Go for the steamboat,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHuckleberry; we’ll come down to the village on her.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.  Pretty soon we come to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of big carpet-bags by him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Run her nose in shore,” says the king.  I done it.  “Wher’ you bound
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor, young man?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“For the steamboat; going to Orleans.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Git aboard,” says the king.  “Hold on a minute, my servant ‘ll he’p you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith them bags.  Jump out and he’p the gentleman, Adolphus”--meaning me,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he’d come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung fellow says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome mighty near getting here in time.’  But then I says again, ‘No, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t be paddling up the river.’  You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_ain’t_ him, are you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, my name’s Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBlodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ the Lord’s poor servants.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But still I’m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin time, all the same, if he’s missed anything by it--which I hope he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thasn’t.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get that all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\telse all these three weeks; hadn’t seen him since they was boys
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether--and hadn’t ever seen his brother William at all--that’s the deef
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand dumb one--William ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five.  Peter and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGeorge were the only ones that come out here; George was the married
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrother; him and his wife both died last year.  Harvey and William’s the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got here
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin time.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did anybody send ‘em word?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls was too young to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn’t seem
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto care much to live.  He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWilliam, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbear to make a will.  He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tproperty divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right--for George
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t leave nothing.  And that letter was all they could get him to put
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta pen to.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come?  Wher’ does he live?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn’t ever been in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis country.  He hasn’t had any too much time--and besides he mightn’t a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot the letter at all, you know.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tYou going to Orleans, you say?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it.  I’m going in a ship, next
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a pretty long journey.  But it’ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIs Mary Jane the oldest?  How old is the others?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfourteen--that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thare-lip.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t going to let them come to no harm.  There’s Hobson, the Babtis’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpreacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow Bartley, and--well, there’s a lot of them; but these are the ones
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the wrote home; so Harvey ‘ll know where to look for friends when he gets
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat young fellow.  Blamed if he didn’t inquire about everybody and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPeter’s business--which was a tanner; and about George’s--which was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarpenter; and about Harvey’s--which was a dissentering minister; and so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton, and so on.  Then he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t stop
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere.  When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail.  A Cincinnati boat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill, but this is a St. Louis one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Was Peter Wilks well off?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleft three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“When did you say he died?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’t say, but it was last night.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, ‘bout the middle of the day.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go, one time or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re all right.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, sir, it’s the best way.  Ma used to always say that.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarpet-bags.  And if he’s gone over to t’other side, go over there and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgit him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  When
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlog, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid it--every last word of it.  And all the time he was a-doing it he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta slouch. I can’t imitate him, and so I ain’t a-going to try to; but he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treally done it pretty good.  Then he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they waited for a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteamboat.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut they didn’t come from high enough up the river; but at last there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid they wouldn’t land us.  But the king was ca’m.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry ‘em, can’t it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvillage they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher’ Mr. Peter Wilks lives?” they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What d’ I tell you?”  Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlive yesterday evening.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s too, too hard!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn’t drop a carpet-bag and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbust out a-crying.  If they warn’t the beatenest lot, them two frauds,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ever I struck.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this brother’s last moments, and the king he told it all over again on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike they’d lost the twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anything
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike it, I’m a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trace.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXV.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir coats as they come.  Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.  The windows and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is it _them_?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You bet it is.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree girls was standing in the door.  Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat don’t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat last and have such good times.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen him and the duke, with a hand across each other’s shoulder, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tt’other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople saying “Sh!” and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.  And when they got there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen they put their arms around each other’s necks, and hung their chins
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover each other’s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never see two men leak the way they done.  And, mind you, everybody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t’other on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tt’other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.  Well, when it come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tword, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe next woman a show.  I never see anything so disgusting.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworks himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjourney of four thousand mile, but it’s a trial that’s sweetened and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthanks them out of his heart and out of his brother’s heart, because out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof their mouths they can’t, words being too weak and cold, and all that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfit to bust.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tletting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbully.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tname the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tRev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t’other
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld, and the preacher was pinting him right.  Lawyer Bell was away up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Louisville on business.  But the rest was on hand, and so they all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then they shook hands with the duke and didn’t say nothing, but just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the made all sorts of signs with his hands and said “Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t all the time, like a baby that can’t talk.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tGeorge’s family, or to Peter.  And he always let on that Peter wrote him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe things; but that was a lie:  he got every blessed one of them out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking he read it out loud and cried over it.  It give the dwelling-house
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t(which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tland (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcellar.  So these two frauds said they’d go and fetch it up, and have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyaller-boys.  My, the way the king’s eyes did shine!  He slaps the duke
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the shoulder and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, _this_ ain’t bully nor noth’n!  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Why,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don’t_ it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke allowed it did.  They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no use talkin’; bein’ brothers to a rich dead man and

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme, Bilge.  Thish yer comes of trust’n to Providence.  It’s the best
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, in the long run.  I’ve tried ‘em all, and ther’ ain’t no better
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMost everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrust; but no, they must count it.  So they counts it, and it comes out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfour hundred and fifteen dollars short.  Says the king:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it.  Then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s the way of it.  The best way’s to let it go, and keep still about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.  We can spare it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it.  I don’t k’yer noth’n ‘bout
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat--it’s the _count_ I’m thinkin’ about.  We want to be awful square
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand open and above-board here, you know.  We want to lug this h-yer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther’ ain’t noth’n
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuspicious.  But when the dead man says ther’s six thous’n dollars, you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow, we don’t want to--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on,” says the duke.  “Le’s make up the deffisit,” and he begun to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thaul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a most amaz’n’ good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin’ clever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead on you,” says the king.  “Blest if the old Nonesuch ain’t a heppin’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus out agin,” and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say,” says the duke, “I got another idea.  Le’s go up stairs and count
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good land, duke, lemme hug you!  It’s the most dazzling idea ‘at ever a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman struck.  You have cert’nly got the most astonishin’ head I ever see.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOh, this is the boss dodge, ther’ ain’t no mistake ‘bout it.  Let ‘em
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this ‘ll lay ‘em out.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\telegant little piles.  Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchops.  Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto swell himself up for another speech.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem that’s left behind in the vale of sorrers.  He has done generous by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that’s left
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfatherless and motherless.  Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould a done _more_ generous by ‘em if he hadn’t ben afeard o’ woundin’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this dear William and me.  Now, _wouldn’t_ he?  Ther’ ain’t no question
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘bout it in _my_ mind.  Well, then, what kind o’ brothers would it be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ‘d stand in his way at sech a time?  And what kind o’ uncles would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit be that ‘d rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these ‘at he loved
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso at sech a time?  If I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjest ask him.” He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmeaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.  Then the king says,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I knowed it; I reckon _that ‘ll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it.  Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_all_.  It’s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.  And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands off of them frauds, saying all the time:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall busy listening.  The king was saying--in the middle of something he’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted in on--
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“--they bein’ partickler friends o’ the diseased.  That’s why they’re
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinvited here this evenin’; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it’s fitten that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this funeral orgies sh’d be public.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the couldn’t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Obsequies_, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treaching it over people’s heads to him.  The king he reads it and puts
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit in his pocket, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart’s_ aluz right.  Asks me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make ‘em all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twelcome.  But he needn’t a worried--it was jest what I was at.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he weaves along again, perfectly ca’m, and goes to dropping in his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfuneral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.  And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he done it the third time he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I say orgies, not because it’s the common term, because it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t--obsequies bein’ the common term--but because orgies is the right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tterm. Obsequies ain’t used in England no more now--it’s gone out.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay orgies now in England.  Orgies is better, because it means the thing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’re after more exact.  It’s a word that’s made up out’n the Greek
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup; hence in_ter._  So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfuneral.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was the _worst_ I ever struck.  Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright in his face.  Everybody was shocked.  Everybody says, “Why,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_doctor_!” and Abner Shackleford says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Robinson, hain’t you heard the news?  This is Harvey Wilks.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is it my poor brother’s dear good friend and physician?  I--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Keep your hands off of me!” says the doctor.  “_You_ talk like an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEnglishman, _don’t_ you?  It’s the worst imitation I ever heard.  _You_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPeter Wilks’s brother!  You’re a fraud, that’s what you are!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, how they all took on!  They crowded around the doctor and tried to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey ‘d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHarvey’s feelings and the poor girl’s feelings, and all that.  But it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be an Englishman and couldn’t imitate the lingo no better than what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the did was a fraud and a liar.  The poor girls was hanging to the king
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_.  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was your father’s friend, and I’m your friend; and I warn you as a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfriend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tharm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas he calls it.  He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfoolish friends here, who ought to know better.  Mary Jane Wilks, you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.  Now listen
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it.  Will you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome!  She
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Here_ is my answer.”  She hove up the bag of money and put it in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking’s hands, and says, “Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme and my sisters any way you want to, and don’t give us no receipt for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thare-lip done the same on the other.  Everybody clapped their hands and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead and smiled proud.  The doctor says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter.  But I warn you all that a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime ‘s coming when you’re going to feel sick whenever you think of this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tday.” And away he went.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, doctor,” says the king, kinder mocking him; “we’ll try and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget ‘em to send for you;” which made them all laugh, and they said it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a prime good hit.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXVI.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tUncle William, and she’d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplain but nice.  She said she’d have her frocks and a lot of other traps
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey’s way, but he said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey warn’t.  The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.  There was an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith.  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese fixings, and so don’t disturb them.  The duke’s room was pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmall, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I stood behind the king and the duke’s chairs and waited on them,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the niggers waited on the rest.  Mary Jane she set at the head of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforce out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand said so--said “How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?” and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where, for the land’s sake, _did_ you get these amaz’n pickles?” and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsupper, you know.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe things.  The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I didn’t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes.  She says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you ever see the king?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who?  William Fourth?  Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.”  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on.  So when I says he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoes to our church, she says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What--regular?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--regular.  His pew’s right over opposite ourn--on t’other side the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpulpit.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I thought he lived in London?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he does.  Where _would_ he live?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see I was up a stump.  I had to let on to get choked with a chicken
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbone, so as to get time to think how to get down again.  Then I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield.  That’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, how you talk--Sheffield ain’t on the sea.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, who said it was?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you did.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I _didn’t_ nuther.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You did!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’t.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You did.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I never said nothing of the kind.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what _did_ you say, then?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Said he come to take the sea _baths_--that’s what I said.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsea?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any Congress-water?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, no.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbath.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How does he get it, then?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels.  There
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the palace at Sheffield they’ve got furnaces, and he wants his water
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thot.  They can’t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey haven’t got no conveniences for it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I see, now.  You might a said that in the first place and saved
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable and glad.  Next, she says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you go to church, too?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--regular.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where do you set?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, in our pew.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Whose_ pew?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey’s.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“His’n?  What does _he_ want with a pew?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wants it to set in.  What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I thought he’d be in the pulpit.”

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tRot him, I forgot he was a preacher.  I see I was up a stump again, so I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplayed another chicken bone and got another think.  Then I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a church?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, what do they want with more?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What!--to preach before a king?  I never did see such a girl as you.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey don’t have no less than seventeen.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Seventeen!  My land!  Why, I wouldn’t set out such a string as that,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot if I _never_ got to glory.  It must take ‘em a week.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks, they don’t _all_ of ‘em preach the same day--only _one_ of ‘em.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what does the rest of ‘em do?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, nothing much.  Loll around, pass the plate--and one thing or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother.  But mainly they don’t do nothing.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what are they _for_?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, they’re for _style_.  Don’t you know nothing?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t _want_ to know no such foolishness as that.  How is
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tservants treated in England?  Do they treat ‘em better ‘n we treat our
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tniggers?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_No_!  A servant ain’t nobody there.  They treat them worse than dogs.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t they give ‘em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tweek, and Fourth of July?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, just listen!  A body could tell _you_ hain’t ever been to England
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby that.  Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tend to year’s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshows, nor nowheres.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nor church?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nor church.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But _you_ always went to church.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I was gone up again.  I forgot I was the old man’s servant.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnext minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifferent from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaw.  But I didn’t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t satisfied.  She says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honest injun, now, hain’t you been telling me a lot of lies?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honest injun,” says I.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“None of it at all?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“None of it at all.  Not a lie in it,” says I.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lay your hand on this book and say it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see it warn’t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid it.  So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, I’ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelieve the rest.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is it you won’t believe, Joe?” says Mary Jane, stepping in with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSusan behind her.  “It ain’t right nor kind for you to talk so to him,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand him a stranger and so far from his people.  How would you like to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttreated so?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’re hurt.  I hain’t done nothing to him.  He’s told some stretchers,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckon, and I said I wouldn’t swallow it all; and that’s every bit
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand grain I _did_ say.  I reckon he can stand a little thing like that,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t he?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t care whether ‘twas little or whether ‘twas big; he’s here in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tour house and a stranger, and it wasn’t good of you to say it.  If you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn’t to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsay a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Mam, he said--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It don’t make no difference what he _said_--that ain’t the thing.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim remember he ain’t in his own country and amongst his own folks.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I’m letting that old reptile rob
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther of her money!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you’ll believe me, she did give
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHare-lip hark from the tomb!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSays I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I’m letting him rob her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof her money!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain--which was her way; but when she got done there warn’t hardly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything left o’ poor Hare-lip.  So she hollered.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, then,” says the other girls; “you just ask his pardon.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe done it, too; and she done it beautiful.  She done it so beautiful
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe could do it again.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says to myself, this is _another_ one that I’m letting him rob her of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther money.  And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.  I felt so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind’s made up;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll hive that money for them or bust.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.  When
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got by myself I went to thinking the thing over.  I says to myself,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?  No--that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  No--I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdasn’t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they’ve got the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney, and they’d slide right out and get away with it.  If she was to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetch in help I’d get mixed up in the business before it was done with,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judge.  No; there ain’t no good way but one.  I got to steal that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won’t suspicion
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat I done it. They’ve got a good thing here, and they ain’t a-going
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto leave till they’ve played this family and this town for all they’re
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworth, so I’ll find a chance time enough. I’ll steal it and hide it; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby and by, when I’m away down the river, I’ll write a letter and tell
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane where it’s hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause the doctor maybe hasn’t let up as much as he lets on he has; he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmight scare them out of here yet.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo, thinks I, I’ll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark, but I found the duke’s room, and started to paw around it with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy hands; but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king to let
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn’t do nothing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twithout a candle, and I dasn’t light one, of course.  So I judged I’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.  About that time
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treached for it, but it wasn’t where I thought it would be; but I touched
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn’t found the bed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it’s kind of natural to hide under
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe king says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin’ short, because it’s better for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than up here givin’ ‘em a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchance to talk us over.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, this is it, Capet.  I ain’t easy; I ain’t comfortable.  That
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoctor lays on my mind.  I wanted to know your plans.  I’ve got a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotion, and I think it’s a sound one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is it, duke?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit down the river with what we’ve got.  Specially, seeing we got it so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teasy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcourse we allowed to have to steal it back.  I’m for knocking off and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlighting out.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat made me feel pretty bad.  About an hour or two ago it would a been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking rips out and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What!  And not sell out the rest o’ the property?  March off like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ dollars’ worth o’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tproperty layin’ around jest sufferin’ to be scooped in?--and all good,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsalable stuff, too.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to go no deeper--didn’t want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey had.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, how you talk!” says the king.  “We sha’n’t rob ‘em of nothing at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall but jest this money.  The people that _buys_ the property is the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuff’rers; because as soon ‘s it’s found out ‘at we didn’t own it--which
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t be long after we’ve slid--the sale won’t be valid, and it ‘ll all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo back to the estate.  These yer orphans ‘ll git their house back agin,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand that’s enough for _them_; they’re young and spry, and k’n easy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tearn a livin’.  _they_ ain’t a-goin to suffer.  Why, jest think--there’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t nigh so well off.  Bless you, _they_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t got noth’n’ to complain of.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoctor hanging over them.  But the king says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cuss the doctor!  What do we k’yer for _him_?  Hain’t we got all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfools in town on our side?  And ain’t that a big enough majority in any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttown?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they got ready to go down stairs again.  The duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t think we put that money in a good place.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat cheered me up.  I’d begun to think I warn’t going to get a hint of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno kind to help me.  The king says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because Mary Jane ‘ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and put ‘em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot borrow some of it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Your head’s level agin, duke,” says the king; and he comes a-fumbling
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder the curtain two or three foot from where I was.  I stuck tight to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d better do if they did catch me.  But the king he got the bag before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was around.  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmakes up the feather-bed, and don’t turn over the straw tick only about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwice a year, and so it warn’t in no danger of getting stole now.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I knowed better.  I had it out of there before they was half-way
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown stairs.  I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould get a chance to do better.  I judged I better hide it outside
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thouse a good ransacking:  I knowed that very well.  Then I turned in,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith my clothes all on; but I couldn’t a gone to sleep if I’d a wanted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business.  By and by I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to happen.  But nothing did.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXVII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring.  So I tiptoed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong, and got down stairs all right.  There warn’t a sound anywheres.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.  The door
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see there warn’t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn’t there.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trun in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee to hide the bag was in the coffin.  The lid was shoved along about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta foot, showing the dead man’s face down in there, with a wet cloth over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, and his shroud on.  I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe person coming was Mary Jane.  She went to the coffin, very soft, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe begun to cry, though I couldn’t hear her, and her back was to me.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I’d make sure them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatchers hadn’t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all right.  They hadn’t stirred.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplaying out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresk about it.  Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain’t the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing that’s going to happen; the thing that’s going to happen is, the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney ‘ll be found when they come to screw on the lid.  Then the king
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘ll get it again, and it ‘ll be a long day before he gives anybody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown and get it out of there, but I dasn’t try it.  Every minute it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands that nobody hadn’t hired me to take care of.  I don’t wish to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatchers was gone.  There warn’t nobody around but the family and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twidow Bartley and our tribe.  I watched their faces to see if anything
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad been happening, but I couldn’t tell.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.  I see the coffin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to look in under it, with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfolks around.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead man’s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle.  There warn’t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfuneral than they do at other places except church.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblack gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttouches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand making no more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved people
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit with nods, and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee; and there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcolicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat had a good thing, according to my notion.  Then the Reverend Hobson
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\topened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toutrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t hear yourself think.  It was right down awkward, and nobody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t seem to know what to do.  But pretty soon they see that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you worry--just depend on me.”  Then he stooped down and begun
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theads.  So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsides of the room, he disappears down cellar.  Then in about two seconds
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk where he left off.  In a minute or two here comes this undertaker’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tglided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover the people’s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “_He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad a rat_!”  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this place.  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause naturally they wanted to know.  A little thing like that don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes a man to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked up to and liked.  There warn’t no more popular man in town than
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat that undertaker was.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoffin with his screw-driver.  I was in a sweat then, and watched him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.  So there I was!  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t know whether the money was in there or not.  So, says I, s’pose
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto write to Mary Jane or not? S’pose she dug him up and didn’t find
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thunted up and jailed; I’d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall; the thing’s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I’ve worsened it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta hundred times, and I wish to goodness I’d just let it alone, dad fetch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe whole business!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain--I couldn’t help it, and I couldn’t rest easy.  But nothing come of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit; the faces didn’t tell me nothing.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcongregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.  He was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstay longer, but they said they could see it couldn’t be done.  And he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.  Them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting fooled and lied to so, but I didn’t see no safe way for me to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchip in and change the general tune.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, blamed if the king didn’t bill the house and the niggers and all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls’ joy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot the first jolt.  A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmother down the river to Orleans.  I thought them poor girls and them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tniggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.  The girls
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid they hadn’t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway from the town.  I can’t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other’s necks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand crying; and I reckon I couldn’t a stood it all, but would a had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn’t knowed the sale warn’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccount and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren that way.  It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou the duke was powerful uneasy.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext day was auction day.  About broad day in the morning the king and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat there was trouble.  The king says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Was you in my room night before last?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, your majesty”--which was the way I always called him when nobody but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tour gang warn’t around.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Was you in there yisterday er last night?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, your majesty.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honor bright, now--no lies.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honor bright, your majesty, I’m telling you the truth.  I hain’t been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit to you.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Have you seen anybody else go in there?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stop and think.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoth of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn’t ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texpected it, and then like they _had_.  Then the duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What, all of them?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don’t think I ever see them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall come _out_ at once but just one time.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello!  When was that?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It was the day we had the funeral.  In the morning.  It warn’t early,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause I overslept.  I was just starting down the ladder, and I see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, go on, _go_ on!  What did they do?  How’d they act?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They didn’t do nothing.  And they didn’t act anyway much, as fur as I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they’d shoved in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere to do up your majesty’s room, or something, s’posing you was up;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand found you _warn’t_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn’t already waked you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Great guns, _this_ is a go!” says the king; and both of them looked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty sick and tolerable silly.  They stood there a-thinking and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle raspy chuckle, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.  They let on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be _sorry_ they was going out of this region!  And I believed they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.  Don’t ever tell _me_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tany more that a nigger ain’t got any histrionic talent.  Why, the way
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey played that thing it would fool _anybody_.  In my opinion, there’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta fortune in ‘em.  If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn’t want a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter lay-out than that--and here we’ve gone and sold ‘em for a song.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Yes, and ain’t privileged to sing the song yet.  Say, where _is_ that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsong--that draft?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“In the bank for to be collected.  Where _would_ it be?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, _that’s_ all right then, thank goodness.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSays I, kind of timid-like:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is something gone wrong?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king whirls on me and rips out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“None o’ your business!  You keep your head shet, and mind y’r own
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taffairs--if you got any.  Long as you’re in this town don’t you forgit
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_that_--you hear?”  Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand say noth’n’:  mum’s the word for _us_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick sales _and_ small profits!  It’s a good business--yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king snarls around on him and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ‘em out so quick.  If the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprofits has turned out to be none, lackin’ considable, and none to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarry, is it my fault any more’n it’s yourn?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, _they’d_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn’t_ if I could a got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy advice listened to.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround and lit into _me_ again.  He give me down the banks for not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up.  And then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he’d be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblamed if he’d ever do it again.  So they went off a-jawing; and I felt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdreadful glad I’d worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone the niggers no harm by it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXVIII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBY and by it was getting-up time.  So I come down the ladder and started
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor down-stairs; but as I come to the girls’ room the door was open, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen packing things in it--getting ready to go to England.  But she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands, crying.  I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent in there and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t--most always.  Tell me about it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she done it.  And it was the niggers--I just expected it.  She said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe children warn’t ever going to see each other no more--and then busted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain’t _ever_ going to see each other any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it!” says I.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLaws, it was out before I could think!  And before I could budge she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrows her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_again_, say it _again_!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\timpatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teased-up, like a person that’s had a tooth pulled out.  So I went to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstudying it out.  I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthough I ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; but it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest if it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it.  Well, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance it; I’ll up and tell the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttruth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpowder and touching it off just to see where you’ll go to. Then I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould go and stay three or four days?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s.  Why?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never mind why yet.  If I’ll tell you how I know the niggers will see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teach other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ how
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop’s and stay four days?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Four days!” she says; “I’ll stay a year!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right,” I says, “I don’t want nothing more out of _you_ than just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour word--I druther have it than another man’s kiss-the-Bible.”  She
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, “If you don’t mind it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll shut the door--and bolt it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I come back and set down again, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you holler.  Just set still and take it like a man.  I got to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it’s a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain’t no help for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.  These uncles of yourn ain’t no uncles at all; they’re a couple of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrauds--regular dead-beats.  There, now we’re over the worst of it, you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan stand the rest middling easy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflung herself on to the king’s breast at the front door and he kissed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafire like sunset, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The brute!  Come, don’t waste a minute--not a _second_--we’ll have them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSays I:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cert’nly.  But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop’s, or--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh,” she says, “what am I _thinking_ about!” she says, and set right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown again.  “Don’t mind what I said--please don’t--you _won’t,_ now,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_will_ you?” Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI said I would die first.  “I never thought, I was so stirred up,” she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays; “now go on, and I won’t do so any more.  You tell me what to do,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand whatever you say I’ll do it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I’m fixed so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdruther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget me out of their claws, and I’d be all right; but there’d be another
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperson that you don’t know about who’d be in big trouble.  Well, we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to save _him_, hain’t we?  Of course.  Well, then, we won’t blow on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSaying them words put a good idea in my head.  I see how maybe I could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto answer questions but me; so I didn’t want the plan to begin working
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill pretty late to-night.  I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and you won’t have to stay
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther.  How fur is it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that ‘ll answer.  Now you go along out there, and lay low
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain--tell them you’ve thought of something.  If you get here before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\televen put a candle in this window, and if I don’t turn up wait _till_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\televen, and _then_ if I don’t turn up it means I’m gone, and out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese beats jailed.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good,” she says, “I’ll do it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“And if it just happens so that I don’t get away, but get took up along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand you must stand by me all you can.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stand by you! indeed I will.  They sha’n’t touch a hair of your head!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, too.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If I get away I sha’n’t be here,” I says, “to prove these rapscallions
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do it if I _was_ here.  I could swear
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey was beats and bummers, that’s all, though that’s worth something.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, there’s others can do that better than what I can, and they’re
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople that ain’t going to be doubted as quick as I’d be.  I’ll tell you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow to find them.  Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.  There--‘Royal
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNonesuch, Bricksville.’  Put it away, and don’t lose it.  When the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcourt wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBricksville and say they’ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand ask for some witnesses--why, you’ll have that entire town down here
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.  And they’ll come a-biling, too.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged we had got everything fixed about right now.  So I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Just let the auction go right along, and don’t worry.  Nobody don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton accounts of the short notice, and they ain’t going out of this till
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey get that money; and the way we’ve fixed it the sale ain’t going to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcount, and they ain’t going to get no money.  It’s just like the way
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was with the niggers--it warn’t no sale, and the niggers will be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback before long.  Why, they can’t collect the money for the _niggers_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyet--they’re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now, and then I’ll start
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight for Mr. Lothrop’s.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Deed, _that_ ain’t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,” I says, “by no manner
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof means; go _before_ breakfast.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don’t know.  What was it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, it’s because you ain’t one of these leather-face people.  I don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant no better book than what your face is.  A body can set down and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tread it off like coarse print.  Do you reckon you can go and face your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There, there, don’t!  Yes, I’ll go before breakfast--I’ll be glad to.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd leave my sisters with them?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes; never mind about them.  They’ve got to stand it yet a while.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmight suspicion something if all of you was to go.  I don’t want you to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I’ll fix it with all of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem. I’ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see a friend, and you’ll be back to-night or early in the morning.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love given to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, it sha’n’t be.”  It was well enough to tell _her_ so--no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tharm in it.  It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe little things that smooths people’s roads the most, down here below;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn’t cost nothing.  Then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:  “There’s one more thing--that bag of money.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_how_ they got it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, you’re out, there.  They hain’t got it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, who’s got it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wish I knowed, but I don’t.  I _had_ it, because I stole it from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I’m
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tafraid it ain’t there no more.  I’m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I’m
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome to, and run--and it warn’t a good place.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, stop blaming yourself--it’s too bad to do it, and I won’t allow
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t your fault.  Where did you hide it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcorpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.  So
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a minute I didn’t say nothing; then I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’d ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind letting me off; but I’ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop’s, if you want to.  Do you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon that ‘ll do?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I wrote:  “I put it in the coffin.  It was in there when you was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrying there, away in the night.  I was behind the door, and I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\therself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand, hard, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Good_-bye.  I’m going to do everything just as you’ve told me; and if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI don’t ever see you again, I sha’n’t ever forget you and I’ll think of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou a many and a many a time, and I’ll _pray_ for you, too!”--and she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPray for me!  I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that was more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnearer her size.  But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind.  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t no back-down to her, I judge.  You may say what you want to, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy opinion she was just full of sand.  It sounds like flattery, but it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t no flattery.  And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlays over them all.  I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther go out of that door; no, I hain’t ever seen her since, but I reckon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe would pray for me; and if ever I’d a thought it would do any good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or bust.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther go.  When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the name of them people over on t’other side of the river that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou all goes to see sometimes?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There’s several; but it’s the Proctors, mainly.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s the name,” I says; “I most forgot it.  Well, Miss Mary Jane she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold me to tell you she’s gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem’s sick.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Which one?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it’s--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sakes alive, I hope it ain’t _Hanner_?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m sorry to say it,” I says, “but Hanner’s the very one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My goodness, and she so well only last week!  Is she took bad?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no name for it.  They set up with her all night, Miss Mary
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJane said, and they don’t think she’ll last many hours.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Only think of that, now!  What’s the matter with her?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI couldn’t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mumps.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mumps your granny!  They don’t set up with people that’s got the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmumps.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They don’t, don’t they?  You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t These mumps is different.  It’s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How’s it a new kind?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because it’s mixed up with other things.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What other things?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don’t know what all.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My land!  And they call it the _mumps_?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s what Miss Mary Jane said.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, because it _is_ the mumps.  That’s what it starts with.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, ther’ ain’t no sense in it.  A body might stump his toe, and take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup and say, ‘Why, he stumped his _toe_.’  Would ther’ be any sense
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin that? _No_.  And ther’ ain’t no sense in _this_, nuther.  Is it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tketching?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is it _ketching_?  Why, how you talk.  Is a _harrow_ catching--in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark? If you don’t hitch on to one tooth, you’re bound to on another,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t you? And you can’t get away with that tooth without fetching the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhole harrow along, can you?  Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tharrow, as you may say--and it ain’t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome to get it hitched on good.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it’s awful, I think,” says the hare-lip.  “I’ll go to Uncle
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHarvey and--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, yes,” I says, “I _would_.  Of _course_ I would.  I wouldn’t lose no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, why wouldn’t you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.  Hain’t your uncles
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tobleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can?  And do you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon they’d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood. Your uncle Harvey’s a preacher, ain’t he?  Very well, then; is a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta _ship clerk?_--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?  Now
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_you_ know he ain’t.  What _will_ he do, then?  Why, he’ll say, ‘It’s a

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, anyway, maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Listen at that, now.  You do beat all for natural stupidness.  Can’t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell anybody at _all_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, maybe you’re right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she’s gone out a while,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway, so he won’t be uneasy about her?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.  She says, ‘Tell them to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I’ve run over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river to see Mr.’--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain’t it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can’t ever seem to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tremember them, half the time, somehow.  Yes, she said, say she has run
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit than anybody else; and she’s going to stick to them till they say
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’ll come, and then, if she ain’t too tired, she’s coming home; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif she is, she’ll be home in the morning anyway.  She said, don’t say
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which ‘ll be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe house; I know it, because she told me so herself.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right,” they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverything was all right now.  The girls wouldn’t say nothing because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDoctor Robinson.  I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned Tom Sawyer couldn’t a done it no neater himself.  Of course he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould a throwed more style into it, but I can’t do that very handy, not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeing brung up to it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tauctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.  So
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor wanting to swallow _everything_.  Well, whilst they was at it a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Here’s_ your opposition line! here’s your two sets o’ heirs to old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPeter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXIX.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.  But I didn’t see no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjoke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see any.  I reckoned they’d turn pale.  But no, nary a pale did
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoogling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld.  Oh, he done it admirable.  Lots of the principal people
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side.  That old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.  Pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEnglishman--not the king’s way, though the king’s _was_ pretty good for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tan imitation.  I can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitate
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“This is a surprise to me which I wasn’t looking for; and I’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tacknowledge, candid and frank, I ain’t very well fixed to meet it and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanswer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he’s broke his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tarm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight by a mistake.  I am Peter Wilks’ brother Harvey, and this is his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrother William, which can’t hear nor speak--and can’t even make signs to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamount to much, now’t he’s only got one hand to work them with.  We are
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twho we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprove it. But up till then I won’t say nothing more, but go to the hotel
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand wait.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblethers out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain’t_ it?--and very convenient, too,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a fraud that’s got to make signs, and ain’t learnt how.  Lost
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir baggage! That’s _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_circumstances_!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor maybe half a dozen.  One of these was that doctor; another one was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when’d you come to this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttown?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But what time o’ day?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“In the evenin’--‘bout an hour er two before sundown.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_How’d_ you come?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, how’d you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_’--in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcanoe?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I warn’t up at the Pint in the mornin’.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a lie.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSeveral of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told man and a preacher.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Preacher be hanged, he’s a fraud and a liar.  He was up at the Pint
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat mornin’.  I live up there, don’t I?  Well, I was up there, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the was up there.  I see him there.  He come in a canoe, along with Tim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCollins and a boy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe doctor he up and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon I would, but I don’t know.  Why, yonder he is, now.  I know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim perfectly easy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was me he pointed at.  The doctor says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Neighbors, I don’t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_these_ two ain’t frauds, I am an idiot, that’s all.  I think it’s our
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduty to see that they don’t get away from here till we’ve looked into
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.  We’ll take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese fellows to the tavern and affront them with t’other couple, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon we’ll find out _something_ before we get through.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king’s friends; so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe all started.  It was about sundown.  The doctor he led me along by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched in the new couple.  First, the doctor says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they’re
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrauds, and they may have complices that we don’t know nothing about.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t If they have, won’t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWilks left?  It ain’t unlikely.  If these men ain’t frauds, they won’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tobject to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’re all right--ain’t that so?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody agreed to that.  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttight place right at the outstart.  But the king he only looked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsorrowful, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain’t got no disposition
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’ this misable business; but, alas, the money ain’t there; you k’n send
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see, if you want to.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where is it, then?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinside o’ the straw tick o’ my bed, not wishin’ to bank it for the few
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdays we’d be here, and considerin’ the bed a safe place, we not bein’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to niggers, and suppos’n’ ‘em honest, like servants in England.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The niggers stole it the very next mornin’ after I had went down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstairs; and when I sold ‘em I hadn’t missed the money yit, so they got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclean away with it.  My servant here k’n tell you ‘bout it, gentlemen.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn’t altogether
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelieve him.  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.  I said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t That was all they asked me.  Then the doctor whirls on me and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Are _you_ English, too?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsupper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his’n;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told gentleman was spinning truth and t’other one lies.  And by and by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn’t get pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Set down, my boy; I wouldn’t strain myself if I was you.  I reckon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou ain’t used to lying, it don’t seem to come handy; what you want is
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpractice.  You do it pretty awkward.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If you’d been in town at first, Levi Bell--” The king broke in and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treached out his hand, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, is this my poor dead brother’s old friend that he’s wrote so often
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That ‘ll fix it.  I’ll take the order and send it, along with your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrother’s, and then they’ll know it’s all right.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tturns to the new old gentleman and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn’t read it.  The lawyer looked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpowerful astonished, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it beats _me_”--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand examined them, and then examined the old man’s writing, and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_them_ again; and then says:  “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand here’s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrite them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here’s _this_ old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgentleman’s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrite them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain’t properly _writing_ at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall.  Now, here’s some letters from--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe new old gentleman says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere--so he copies for me.  It’s _his_ hand you’ve got there, not mine.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Well_!” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things.  I’ve got some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof William’s letters, too; so if you’ll get him to write a line or so we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan com--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He _can’t_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman.  “If he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand mine too.  Look at both, please--they’re by the same hand.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe lawyer done it, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I believe it’s so--and if it ain’t so, there’s a heap stronger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresemblance than I’d noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthought we was right on the track of a solution, but it’s gone to grass,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpartly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain’t either of ‘em
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWilkses”--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn’t give in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_then_! Indeed he wouldn’t.  Said it warn’t no fair test.  Said his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn’t tried
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ve thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it.  We’re both here.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the old man turns towards the king, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBlamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty quick, or he’d a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsqushed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He whitened a little; he couldn’t help it; and it was mighty still in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI to myself, _now_ he’ll throw up the sponge--there ain’t no more use.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, did he?  A body can’t hardly believe it, but he didn’t.  I reckon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the thought he’d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mf!  It’s a _very_ tough question, _ain’t_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k’n
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell you what’s tattooed on his breast.  It’s jest a small, thin, blue
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tarrow--that’s what it is; and if you don’t look clost, you can’t see it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t _now_ what do you say--hey?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcheek.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this eye lights up like he judged he’d got the king _this_ time, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“There--you’ve heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWilks’ breast?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoth of them spoke up and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We didn’t see no such mark.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good!” says the old gentleman.  “Now, what you _did_ see on his breast
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W”--and he marked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem that way on a piece of paper.  “Come, ain’t that what you saw?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBoth of them spoke up again, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, we _didn’t_.  We never seen any marks at all.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The whole _bilin_’ of ‘m ‘s frauds!  Le’s duck ‘em! le’s drown ‘em!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tle’s ride ‘em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_please_!  There’s one way yet--let’s go and dig up the corpse and look.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat took them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the doctor sung out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_them_ along, too!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We’ll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don’t find them marks we’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlynch the whole gang!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn’t no getting away, you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgraveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttown at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevening.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAs we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of town;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause now if I could tip her the wink she’d light out and save me, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblow on our dead-beats.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsave me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t find them--
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t think
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmile off, to borrow one.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark wiped it all out, and you couldn’t see nothing at all.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas awful.  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpanting.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand somebody sings out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout and shinned for the road in the dark there ain’t nobody can tell.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbuzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I struck the town I see there warn’t nobody out in the storm, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmain one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdisappointed, I didn’t know why.  But at last, just as I was sailing by,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane’s window! and my heart swelled up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme in the dark, and wasn’t ever going to be before me no more in this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime the lightning showed me one that wasn’t chained I snatched it and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshoved. It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with nothing but a rope.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle of the river, but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I could afforded it.  But I didn’t.  As I sprung aboard I sung out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!  Glory be to goodness, we’re shut
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof them!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfull of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlights out of me.  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tking and the duke, but I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!  Cut loose and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlet her slide!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnobody to bother us.  I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy heels a few times--I couldn’t help it; but about the third crack
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlistened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmaking their skiff hum!  It was the king and the duke.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall I could do to keep from crying.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXX.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tryin’ to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of our company,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\they?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, your majesty, we warn’t--_please_ don’t, your majesty!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I’ll shake the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinsides out o’ you!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honest, I’ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsurprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they’ll hang ye, sure!’ and I lit
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout.  It didn’t seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn’t do nothing,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I didn’t want to be hung if I could get away.  So I never stopped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trunning till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor they’d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tduke wasn’t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tawful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn’t.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyes, it’s _mighty_ likely!” and shook me up again, and said he reckoned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’d drownd me.  But the duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Leggo the boy, you old idiot!  Would _you_ a done any different?  Did
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou inquire around for _him_ when you got loose?  I don’t remember it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. But the duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You better a blame’ sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you’re
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe one that’s entitled to it most.  You hain’t done a thing from the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith that imaginary blue-arrow mark.  That _was_ bright--it was right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown bully; and it was the thing that saved us.  For if it hadn’t been
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor that they’d a jailed us till them Englishmen’s baggage come--and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took ‘em to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgraveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texcited fools hadn’t let go all holts and made that rush to get a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook we’d a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo--longer than _we’d_ need ‘em.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabsent-minded like:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mf!  And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat made me squirm!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, “_we_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdid.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter about a half a minute the king drawls out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Leastways, I did.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says, the same way:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“On the contrary, I did.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king kind of ruffles up, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Looky here, Bilgewater, what’r you referrin’ to?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says, pretty brisk:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was _you_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treferring to?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but I don’t know--maybe you was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasleep, and didn’t know what you was about.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke bristles up now, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame’ fool?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDon’t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Yes_, sir!  I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a lie!”--and the duke went for him.  The king sings out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Take y’r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tintending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit up, and have it all to yourself.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif you didn’t put the money there, say it, and I’ll b’lieve you, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake back everything I said.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You old scoundrel, I didn’t, and you know I didn’t.  There, now!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, I b’lieve you.  But answer me only jest this one more--now
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_don’t_ git mad; didn’t you have it in your mind to hook the money and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thide it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t care if I _did_, I didn’t _do_ it, anyway.  But you not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tonly had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest.  I won’t say
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI warn’t goin’ to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tahead o’ me.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a lie!  You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Nough!--I _own up!_”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthan what I was feeling before.  So the duke took his hands off and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you.  It’s _well_ for you to set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere and blubber like a baby--it’s fitten for you, after the way
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfather.  You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for ‘em.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat rubbage.  Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t me.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dry up!  I don’t want to hear no more out of you!” says the duke.  “And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_now_ you see what you GOT by it.  They’ve got all their own money back,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_.  G’long to bed, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long ‘s _you_ live!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms.  They
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain.  That made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of course when they got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXI.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the river.  We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong ways from home.  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  It was the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdismal.  So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun to work the villages again.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFirst they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn’t make enough
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor them both to get drunk on.  Then in another village they started
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta dancing-school; but they didn’t know no more how to dance than a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin and pranced them out of town.  Another time they tried to go at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyellocution; but they didn’t yellocute long till the audience got up and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgive them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.  They tackled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmissionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little of everything; but they couldn’t seem to have no luck.  So at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfloated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim and me got uneasy.  We didn’t like the look of it.  We judged they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.  We turned it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto somebody’s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbusiness, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagreement that we wouldn’t have nothing in the world to do with such
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tactions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (“House to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trob, you _mean_,” says I to myself; “and when you get through robbing it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft--and you’ll have to take it out in wondering.”) And he said if he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe was to come along.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we stayed where we was.  The duke he fretted and sweated around, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in a mighty sour way.  He scolded us for everything, and we couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSomething was a-brewing, sure.  I was good and glad when midday come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchange on top of it.  So me and the duke went up to the village, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this might, and so tight he couldn’t walk, and couldn’t do nothing to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong day before they ever see me and Jim again.  I got down there all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Set her loose, Jim! we’re all right now!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut there warn’t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.  Jim was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone!  I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno use--old Jim was gone.  Then I set down and cried; I couldn’t help
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. But I couldn’t set still long.  Pretty soon I went out on the road,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasked him if he’d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Whereabouts?” says I.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Down to Silas Phelps’ place, two mile below here.  He’s a runaway
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger, and they’ve got him.  Was you looking for him?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You bet I ain’t!  I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tago, and he said if I hollered he’d cut my livers out--and told me to lay
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown and stay where I was; and I done it.  Been there ever since; afeard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto come out.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” he says, “you needn’t be afeard no more, becuz they’ve got him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe run off f’m down South, som’ers.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a good job they got him.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I _reckon_!  There’s two hunderd dollars reward on him.  It’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike picking up money out’n the road.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I’d been big enough; I see him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_first_. Who nailed him?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tforty dollars, becuz he’s got to go up the river and can’t wait.  Think
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’ that, now!  You bet _I’d_ wait, if it was seven year.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s me, every time,” says I.  “But maybe his chance ain’t worth
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more than that, if he’ll sell it so cheap.  Maybe there’s something
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t straight about it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But it _is_, though--straight as a string.  I see the handbill myself.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t It tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe plantation he’s frum, below Newr_leans_.  No-sirree-_bob_, they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t no trouble ‘bout _that_ speculation, you bet you.  Say, gimme a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchaw tobacker, won’t ye?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t have none, so he left.  I went to the raft, and set down in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twigwam to think.  But I couldn’t come to nothing.  I thought till I wore
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy head sore, but I couldn’t see no way out of the trouble.  After all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis long journey, and after all we’d done for them scoundrels, here it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdirty dollars.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOnce I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe a slave at home where his family was, as long as he’d _got_ to be a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslave, and so I’d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell Miss Watson where he was.  But I soon give up that notion for two
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings: she’d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor leaving her, and so she’d sell him straight down the river again;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they’d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he’d feel ornery and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdisgraced. And then think of _me_!  It would get all around that Huck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFinn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody from that town again I’d be ready to get down and lick his boots
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor shame.  That’s just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen he don’t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan hide it, it ain’t no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly. The more I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstudied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor old woman’s nigger that hadn’t ever done me no harm, and now was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowing me there’s One that’s always on the lookout, and ain’t a-going
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I tried the best I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup wicked, and so I warn’t so much to blame; but something inside of me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkept saying, “There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif you’d a done it they’d a learnt you there that people that acts as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  So
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI kneeled down.  But the words wouldn’t come.  Why wouldn’t they?  It
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from _me_, neither.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed very well why they wouldn’t come.  It was because my heart warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright; it was because I warn’t square; it was because I was playing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdouble.  I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tholding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto that nigger’s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can’t pray a lie--I found
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat out.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn’t know what to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo. At last I had an idea; and I says, I’ll go and write the letter--and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlight as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand wrote:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMiss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treward if you send.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_Huck Finn._
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfelt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn’t do it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thow good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother kind.  I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ‘stead of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcalling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays to myself:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, then, I’ll _go_ to hell”--and tore it up.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhich was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t.  And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the woods,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, “Phelps’s Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn’t mind,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause I didn’t want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstraight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tperformance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hel-_lo_!  Where’d _you_ come from?”  Then he says, kind of glad and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teager, “Where’s the raft?--got her in a good place?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he didn’t look so joyful, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What was your idea for asking _me_?” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s soberer; so I went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.  We didn’t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcountry till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee it was gone, I says to myself, ‘They’ve got into trouble and had to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blamed if I know--that is, what’s become of the raft.  That old fool had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfound the raft gone, we said, ‘That little rascal has stole our raft and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshook us, and run off down the river.’”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wouldn’t shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld, and the only property.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we’d come to consider him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere warn’t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshake. And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat ten cents? Give it here.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney I had, and I hadn’t had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We’d skin him if he done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How can he blow?  Hain’t he run off?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgone.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Sold_ him?”  I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you can’t _get_ your nigger, that’s all--so dry up your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblubbering. Looky here--do you think _you’d_ venture to blow on us?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Blamed if I think I’d trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore. I went on a-whimpering, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t want to blow on nobody; and I ain’t got no time to blow, nohow.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI got to turn out and find my nigger.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpromise you won’t blow, and won’t let the nigger blow, I’ll tell you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere to find him.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I promised, and he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--” and then he stopped.  You see, he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstudy and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas. He wouldn’t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days.  And I’ll start this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery afternoon.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No you wont, you’ll start _now_; and don’t you lose any time about it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tneither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour head and move right along, and then you won’t get into trouble with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_us_, d’ye hear?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to be left free to work my plans.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tidiots don’t require documents--leastways I’ve heard there’s such down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSouth here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward’s bogus,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmaybe he’ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting ‘em out.  Go ‘long now, and tell him anything you want to; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind you don’t work your jaw any _between_ here and there.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn’t look around, but I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps’.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround, because I wanted to stop Jim’s mouth till these fellows could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget away.  I didn’t want no trouble with their kind.  I’d seen all I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike everybody’s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspirits whispering--spirits that’s been dead ever so many years--and you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways think they’re talking about _you_.  As a general thing it makes a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbody wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPhelps’ was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall look alike.  A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlength, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbig yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbroad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t’other
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tside the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted for the kitchen.  When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlonesomest sound in the whole world.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’d noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I left it alone.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.  And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch another powwow as they made!  In a quarter of a minute I was a kind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tA nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand, singing out, “Begone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!” and she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.  There ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno harm in a hound, nohow.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmother’s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey always do.  And here comes the white woman running from the house,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame way the little niggers was doing.  She was smiling all over so she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould hardly stand--and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s _you_, at last!--_ain’t_ it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI out with a “Yes’m” before I thought.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand she couldn’t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, “You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsakes, I don’t care for that, I’m so glad to see you!  Dear, dear, it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoes seem like I could eat you up!  Children, it’s your cousin Tom!--tell
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim howdy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thid behind her.  So she run on:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyour breakfast on the boat?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI said I had got it on the boat.  So then she started for the house,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.  When we got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I’ve been hungry
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it’s come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more.  What kep’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou?--boat get aground?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m--she--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t say yes’m--say Aunt Sally.  Where’d she get aground?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t rightly know what to say, because I didn’t know whether the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboat would be coming up the river or down.  But I go a good deal on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinstinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOrleans. That didn’t help me much, though; for I didn’t know the names
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof bars down that way.  I see I’d got to invent a bar, or forget the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tname of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It warn’t the grounding--that didn’t keep us back but a little.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblowed out a cylinder-head.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good gracious! anybody hurt?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m.  Killed a nigger.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it’s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.  Two years ago
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlast Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.  And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI think he died afterwards.  He was a Baptist.  Your uncle Silas knowed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.  Yes, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tremember now, he _did_ die.  Mortification set in, and they had to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamputate him. But it didn’t save him.  Yes, it was mortification--that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas it.  He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresurrection. They say he was a sight to look at.  Your uncle’s been up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the town every day to fetch you. And he’s gone again, not more’n an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thour ago; he’ll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t you?--oldish man, with a--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, I didn’t see nobody, Aunt Sally.  The boat landed just at daylight,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon; and so I come down the back way.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’d you give the baggage to?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nobody.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, child, it ‘ll be stole!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t,” I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was kinder thin ice, but I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlunch, and give me all I wanted.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was getting so uneasy I couldn’t listen good.  I had my mind on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem a little, and find out who I was.  But I couldn’t get no show, Mrs.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPhelps kept it up and run on so.  Pretty soon she made the cold chills
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstreak all down my back, because she says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But here we’re a-running on this way, and you hain’t told me a word
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout Sis, nor any of them.  Now I’ll rest my works a little, and you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstart up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about ‘m all every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of ‘m; and how they are, and what they’re doing, and what they told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I see I was up a stump--and up it good.  Providence had stood by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.  I see it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t a bit of use to try to go ahead--I’d got to throw up my hand.  So
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says to myself, here’s another place where I got to resk the truth.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bed, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here he comes!  Stick your head down lower--there, that’ll do; you can’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe seen now.  Don’t you let on you’re here.  I’ll play a joke on him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tChildren, don’t you say a word.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see I was in a fix now.  But it warn’t no use to worry; there warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunder when the lightning struck.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bed hid him.  Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Has he come?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” says her husband.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good-_ness_ gracious!” she says, “what in the warld can have become of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I can’t imagine,” says the old gentleman; “and I must say it makes me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdreadful uneasy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Uneasy!” she says; “I’m ready to go distracted!  He _must_ a come; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve missed him along the road.  I _know_ it’s so--something tells me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Sally, I _couldn’t_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say!  He must a come!  You must a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmissed him.  He--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, don’t distress me any more’n I’m already distressed.  I don’t know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat in the world to make of it.  I’m at my wit’s end, and I don’t mind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tacknowledging ‘t I’m right down scared.  But there’s no hope that he’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome; for he _couldn’t_ come and me miss him.  Sally, it’s terrible--just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tterrible--something’s happened to the boat, sure!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Silas!  Look yonder!--up the road!--ain’t that somebody coming?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPhelps the chance she wanted.  She stooped down quick at the foot of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twindow there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.  The old gentleman stared,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, who’s that?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who do you reckon ‘t is?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t no idea.  Who _is_ it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s _Tom Sawyer!_”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBy jings, I most slumped through the floor!  But there warn’t no time to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tswap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the rest of the tribe.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut if they was joyful, it warn’t nothing to what I was; for it was like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeing born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.  Well, they froze
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.  And I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texplained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhite River, and it took us three days to fix it.  Which was all right,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand worked first-rate; because _they_ didn’t know but what it would take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree days to fix it.  If I’d a called it a bolthead it would a done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust as well.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNow I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuncomfortable all up the other.  Being Tom Sawyer was easy and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteamboat coughing along down the river.  Then I says to myself, s’pose
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom Sawyer comes down on that boat?  And s’pose he steps in here any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquiet?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I couldn’t _have_ it that way; it wouldn’t do at all.  I must go
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup the road and waylay him.  So I told the folks I reckoned I would go
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup to the town and fetch down my baggage.  The old gentleman was for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI druther he wouldn’t take no trouble about me.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXIII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaited till he come along.  I says “Hold on!” and it stopped alongside,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo or three times like a person that’s got a dry throat, and then says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t ever done you no harm.  You know that.  So, then, what you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to come back and ha’nt _me_ for?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t come back--I hain’t been _gone_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn’t quite
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied yet.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn’t on you.  Honest injun
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, you ain’t a ghost?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Honest injun, I ain’t,” I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can’t somehow
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem to understand it no way.  Looky here, warn’t you ever murdered _at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall?_”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No.  I warn’t ever murdered at all--I played it on them.  You come in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there and feel of me if you don’t believe me.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain he didn’t know what to do.  And he wanted to know all about it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thit him where he lived.  But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, let him alone a minute, and don’t disturb him.  So he thought and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthought, and pretty soon he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s all right; I’ve got it.  Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s your’n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thouse about the time you ought to; and I’ll go towards town a piece, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand you needn’t let on to know me at first.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right; but wait a minute.  There’s one more thing--a thing that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_nobody_ don’t know but me.  And that is, there’s a nigger here that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_--old Miss
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWatson’s Jim.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What!  Why, Jim is--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe stopped and went to studying.  I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know what you’ll say.  You’ll say it’s dirty, low-down business; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat if it is?  I’m low down; and I’m a-going to steal him, and I want
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou keep mum and not let on.  Will you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHis eye lit up, and he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll _help_ you steal him!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.  It was the most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tastonishing speech I ever heard--and I’m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tconsiderable in my estimation.  Only I couldn’t believe it.  Tom Sawyer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta _nigger-stealer!_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, shucks!”  I says; “you’re joking.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I ain’t joking, either.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then,” I says, “joking or no joking, if you hear anything said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a runaway nigger, don’t forget to remember that _you_ don’t know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing about him, and I don’t know nothing about him.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway and I drove mine.  But of course I forgot all about driving slow on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquick for that length of a trip.  The old gentleman was at the door, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, this is wonderful!  Whoever would a thought it was in that mare
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto do it?  I wish we’d a timed her.  And she hain’t sweated a hair--not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta hair. It’s wonderful.  Why, I wouldn’t take a hundred dollars for that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thorse now--I wouldn’t, honest; and yet I’d a sold her for fifteen before,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand thought ‘twas all she was worth.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat’s all he said.  He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut it warn’t surprising; because he warn’t only just a farmer, he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworth it, too.  There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone the same way, down South.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn about half an hour Tom’s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyards, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, there’s somebody come!  I wonder who ‘tis?  Why, I do believe it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta stranger.  Jimmy” (that’s one of the children) “run and tell Lize to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tput on another plate for dinner.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest, when he does come.  Tom was over the stile and starting for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all bunched in the front door.  Tom had his store clothes on, and an
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taudience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.  In them circumstances
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit warn’t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuitable.  He warn’t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the come ca’m and important, like the ram.  When he got a-front of us he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat had butterflies asleep in it and he didn’t want to disturb them,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, my boy,” says the old gentleman, “I’m sorry to say ‘t your driver
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thas deceived you; Nichols’s place is down a matter of three mile more.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCome in, come in.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, “Too late--he’s out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof sight.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, he’s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus; and then we’ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols’s.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I _can’t_ make you so much trouble; I couldn’t think of it.  I’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twalk--I don’t mind the distance.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But we won’t _let_ you walk--it wouldn’t be Southern hospitality to do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. Come right in.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, _do_,” says Aunt Sally; “it ain’t a bit of trouble to us, not a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbit in the world.  You must stay.  It’s a long, dusty three mile, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe can’t let you walk.  And, besides, I’ve already told ‘em to put on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother plate when I see you coming; so you mustn’t disappoint us.  Come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright in and make yourself at home.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpersuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother bow.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther hand, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You owdacious puppy!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked kind of hurt, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m surprised at you, m’am.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’re s’rp--Why, what do you reckon I am?  I’ve a good notion to take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked kind of humble, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’t mean nothing, m’am.  I didn’t mean no harm.  I--I--thought you’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you born fool!”  She took up the spinning stick, and it looked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t “What made you think I’d like it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t know.  Only, they--they--told me you would.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_They_ told you I would.  Whoever told you’s _another_ lunatic.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever heard the beat of it.  Who’s _they_?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, everybody.  They all said so, m’am.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’s ‘everybody’?  Out with their names, or ther’ll be an idiot
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshort.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m sorry, and I warn’t expecting it.  They told me to.  They all told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme to.  They all said, kiss her; and said she’d like it.  They all said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--every one of them.  But I’m sorry, m’am, and I won’t do it no more--I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t, honest.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You won’t, won’t you?  Well, I sh’d _reckon_ you won’t!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m, I’m honest about it; I won’t ever do it again--till you ask me.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Till I _ask_ you!  Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I lay you’ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou--or the likes of you.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” he says, “it does surprise me so.  I can’t make it out, somehow.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey said you would, and I thought you would.  But--” He stopped and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman’s, and says, “Didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_you_ think she’d like me to kiss her, sir?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b’lieve I didn’t.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he looks on around the same way to me, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, didn’t _you_ think Aunt Sally ‘d open out her arms and say, ‘Sid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer--’”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My land!” she says, breaking in and jumping for him, “you impudent
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung rascal, to fool a body so--” and was going to hug him, but he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfended her off, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, not till you’ve asked me first.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she didn’t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook what was left.  And after they got a little quiet again she says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn’t looking for _you_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tat all, but only Tom.  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s because it warn’t _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,” he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays; “but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a mistake, Aunt Sally.  This ain’t no healthy place for a stranger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto come.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thain’t been so put out since I don’t know when.  But I don’t care, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t mind the terms--I’d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave you here. Well, to think of that performance!  I don’t deny it, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfamilies--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that’s laid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn’t cool it a bit,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tneither, the way I’ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn’t no use, they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto try to work up to it.  But at supper, at night, one of the little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboys says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pa, mayn’t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain’t going to be any; and you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople; so I reckon they’ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore this time.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo there it was!--but I couldn’t help it.  Tom and me was to sleep in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsame room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn’t believe anybody was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn’t hurry up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand give them one they’d get into trouble sure.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOn the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn’t come back no more, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tRoyal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall over tar and feathers, and didn’t look like nothing in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworld that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn’t ever feel any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee.  Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe see we was too late--couldn’t do no good.  We asked some stragglers
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinnocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe house rose up and went for them.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we poked along back home, and I warn’t feeling so brash as I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hadn’t done nothing.  But that’s always the way; it don’t make no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifference whether you do right or wrong, a person’s conscience ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t know no more than a person’s conscience does I would pison him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt takes up more room than all the rest of a person’s insides, and yet
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t no good, nohow.  Tom Sawyer he says the same.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXIV.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE stopped talking, and got to thinking.  By and by Tom says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  I bet I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow where Jim is.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No!  Where?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“In that hut down by the ash-hopper.  Why, looky here.  When we was at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you think the vittles was for?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“For a dog.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So ‘d I. Well, it wasn’t for a dog.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because part of it was watermelon.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“So it was--I noticed it.  Well, it does beat all that I never thought
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a dog not eating watermelon.  It shows how a body can see and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t see at the same time.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom table--same key, I bet.  Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand it ain’t likely there’s two prisoners on such a little plantation,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand where the people’s all so kind and good.  Jim’s the prisoner.  All
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright--I’m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn’t give shucks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor any other way.  Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’ll take the one we like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe best.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhat a head for just a boy to have!  If I had Tom Sawyer’s head I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I went to thinking out a plan,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplan was going to come from.  Pretty soon Tom says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ready?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right--bring it out.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“My plan is this,” I says.  “We can easy find out if it’s Jim in there.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tisland.  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told man’s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim used to do before.  Wouldn’t that plan work?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Work_?  Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.  But it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo blame’ simple; there ain’t nothing _to_ it.  What’s the good of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplan that ain’t no more trouble than that?  It’s as mild as goose-milk.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Why, Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soap
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfactory.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI never said nothing, because I warn’t expecting nothing different; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave none of them objections to it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd it didn’t.  He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  So I was satisfied,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand said we would waltz in on it.  I needn’t tell what it was here,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way, it was.  I knowed he would be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchanging it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbullinesses wherever he got a chance.  And that is what he done.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tearnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat was the thing that was too many for me.  Here was a boy that was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trespectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thome that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twithout any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore everybody.  I _couldn’t_ understand it no way at all.  It was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toutrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you reckon I know what I’m about?  Don’t I generly know what I’m
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Didn’t I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Well_, then.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat’s all he said, and that’s all I said.  It warn’t no use to say any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore; because when he said he’d do a thing, he always done it.  But I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlet it go, and never bothered no more about it.  If he was bound to have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit so, I couldn’t help it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went through the yard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn’t make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe two sides; and on the side I warn’t acquainted with--which was the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnorth side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone stout board nailed across it.  I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here’s the ticket.  This hole’s big enough for Jim to get through if we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrench off the board.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplaying hooky.  I should _hope_ we can find a way that’s a little more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcomplicated than _that_, Huck Finn.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then,” I says, “how ‘ll it do to saw him out, the way I done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore I was murdered that time?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s more _like_,” he says.  “It’s real mysterious, and troublesome,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand good,” he says; “but I bet we can find a way that’s twice as long.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There ain’t no hurry; le’s keep on looking around.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBetwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjoined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsearched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn’t no connection
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith it; and there warn’t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsome old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now we’re all right.  We’ll _dig_ him out.  It ‘ll take about a week!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto pull a buckskin latch-string, they don’t fasten the doors--but that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclimb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbusted his brains out, he thought he’d got to give it up; but after he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime he made the trip.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleaving, the key come from the house.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmaking him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstrange words and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout his troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So Tom says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur’us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘im?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI hunched Tom, and whispers:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You going, right here in the daybreak?  _that_ warn’t the plan.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan _now_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much.  When we got in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough, and could see us; and he sings out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, _Huck_!  En good _lan_’! ain’ dat Misto Tom?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn’t know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a done it, because that nigger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbusted in and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of wondering, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Does _who_ know us?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What _put_ it dar?  Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out like he knowed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s mighty curious.  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t _what_ did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca’m, and says,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOf course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you sing out?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain’t said nothing, sah.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Not a word?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah, I hain’t said a word.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you ever see us before?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah; not as I knows on.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays, kind of severe:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway?  What made you think
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomebody sung out?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Dey’s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos’ kill me, dey sk’yers me so.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Please to don’t tell nobody ‘bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he’ll scole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme; ‘kase he say dey _ain’t_ no witches.  I jis’ wish to goodness he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theah now--_den_ what would he say!  I jis’ bet he couldn’ fine no way to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgit aroun’ it _dis_ time.  But it’s awluz jis’ so; people dat’s _sot_,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstays sot; dey won’t look into noth’n’en fine it out f’r deyselves, en
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen _you_ fine it out en tell um ‘bout it, dey doan’ b’lieve you.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom give him a dime, and said we wouldn’t tell nobody; and told him to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbuy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.  If I was to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcatch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn’t give
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim up, I’d hang him.”  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t ever let on to know us.  And if you hear any digging going on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnights, it’s us; we’re going to set you free.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome back, and we said we’d come again some time if the nigger wanted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twitches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround then.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXV.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that’s called
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark place.  We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t There ain’t no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatchman.  There ain’t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.  And
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere’s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed:  why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe chain.  And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpunkin-headed nigger, and don’t send nobody to watch the nigger.  Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn’t be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  Why, drat it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck, it’s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe difficulties.  Well, we can’t help it; we got to do the best we can
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the materials we’ve got. Anyhow, there’s one thing--there’s more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thonor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhere there warn’t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\town head.  Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.  When you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tresky.  Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI believe.  Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmake a saw out of the first chance we get.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do we want of a saw?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do we _want_ of it?  Hain’t we got to saw the leg of Jim’s bed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff, so as to get the chain loose?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, if that ain’t just like you, Huck Finn.  You _can_ get up the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinfant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.  Why, hain’t you ever read
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tany books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?  Who ever heard of getting a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?  No; the way all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbest authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso, and swallow the sawdust, so it can’t be found, and put some dirt and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can’t see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno sign of it’s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen, the night you’re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff your chain, and there you are.  Nothing to do but hitch your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere’s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNavarre, or wherever it is. It’s gaudy, Huck.  I wish there was a moat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we’ll dig one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do we want of a moat when we’re going to snake him out from under
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe cabin?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut he never heard me.  He had forgot me and everything else.  He had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this chin in his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead; then sighs again, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, it wouldn’t do--there ain’t necessity enough for it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“For what?”  I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, to saw Jim’s leg off,” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good land!”  I says; “why, there ain’t _no_ necessity for it.  And what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, some of the best authorities has done it.  They couldn’t get the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.  And a leg would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe better still.  But we got to let that go.  There ain’t necessity
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough in this case; and, besides, Jim’s a nigger, and wouldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunderstand the reasons for it, and how it’s the custom in Europe; so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe’ll let it go.  But there’s one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  And we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcan send it to him in a pie; it’s mostly done that way.  And I’ve et
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworse pies.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,” I says; “Jim ain’t got no use for a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trope ladder.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He _has_ got use for it.  How _you_ talk, you better say; you don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow nothing about it.  He’s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What in the nation can he _do_ with it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Do_ with it?  He can hide it in his bed, can’t he?”  That’s what they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall do; and _he’s_ got to, too.  Huck, you don’t ever seem to want to do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything that’s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. S’pose he _don’t_ do nothing with it? ain’t it there in his bed,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a clew, after he’s gone? and don’t you reckon they’ll want clews?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Of course they will.  And you wouldn’t leave them any?  That would be a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn’t_ it!  I never heard of such a thing.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “if it’s in the regulations, and he’s got to have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, all right, let him have it; because I don’t wish to go back on no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tregulations; but there’s one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tour sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we’re going to get into trouble
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith Aunt Sally, just as sure as you’re born.  Now, the way I look at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit, a hickry-bark ladder don’t cost nothing, and don’t waste nothing,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain’t had no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\texperience, and so he don’t care what kind of a--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I’d keep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstill--that’s what I’D do.  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby a hickry-bark ladder?  Why, it’s perfectly ridiculous.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you’ll take my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tadvice, you’ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe said that would do.  And that gave him another idea, and he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Borrow a shirt, too.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do we want of a shirt, Tom?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Journal your granny--_Jim_ can’t write.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“S’pose he _can’t_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can’t he, if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbarrel-hoop?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone; and quicker, too.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Prisoners_ don’t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpens out of, you muggins.  They _always_ make their pens out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they’ve got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto do it by rubbing it on the wall.  _They_ wouldn’t use a goose-quill
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif they had it. It ain’t regular.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what’ll we make him the ink out of?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that’s the common sort
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand women; the best authorities uses their own blood.  Jim can do that;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto let the world know where he’s captivated, he can write it on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.  The
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIron Mask always done that, and it’s a blame’ good way, too.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Jim ain’t got no tin plates.  They feed him in a pan.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That ain’t nothing; we can get him some.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Can’t nobody _read_ his plates.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That ain’t got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn.  All _he’s_ got to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo is to write on the plate and throw it out.  You don’t _have_ to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\table to read it. Why, half the time you can’t read anything a prisoner
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrites on a tin plate, or anywhere else.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what’s the sense in wasting the plates?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, blame it all, it ain’t the _prisoner’s_ plates.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But it’s _somebody’s_ plates, ain’t it?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, spos’n it is?  What does the _prisoner_ care whose--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.  So we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcleared out for the house.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.  I called it borrowing,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tborrowing, it was stealing.  He said we was representing prisoners; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprisoners don’t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t blame them for it, either.  It ain’t no crime in a prisoner to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it’s his right; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of prison with.  He said if we warn’t prisoners it would be a very
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifferent thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the warn’t a prisoner.  So we allowed we would steal everything there was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat come handy.  And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.  But he said I didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tneed it to get out of prison with; there’s where the difference was.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He said if I’d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.  So I let it go at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat, though I couldn’t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdown to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcarried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twatch.  By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto talk.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Everything’s all right now except tools; and that’s easy fixed.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tools?”  I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tools for what?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, to dig with.  We ain’t a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?”

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ain’t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger out with?”  I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero?  Why, they might as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell lend him the key and done with it.  Picks and shovels--why, they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t furnish ‘em to a king.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then,” I says, “if we don’t want the picks and shovels, what do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe want?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A couple of case-knives.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Confound it, it’s foolish, Tom.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It don’t make no difference how foolish it is, it’s the _right_ way--and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s the regular way.  And there ain’t no _other_ way, that ever I heard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof, and I’ve read all the books that gives any information about these
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou; generly it’s through solid rock.  And it takes them weeks and weeks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand weeks, and for ever and ever.  Why, look at one of them prisoners in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, guess.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know.  A month and a half.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Thirty-seven year_--and he come out in China.  _That’s_ the kind.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Jim_ don’t know nobody in China.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s _that_ got to do with it?  Neither did that other fellow.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’re always a-wandering off on a side issue.  Why can’t you stick to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe main point?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right--I don’t care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t, either, I reckon.  But there’s one thing, anyway--Jim’s too old to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe dug out with a case-knife.  He won’t last.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes he will _last_, too.  You don’t reckon it’s going to take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How long will it take, Tom?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, we can’t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttake very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He’ll hear Jim ain’t from there.  Then his next move will be to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tadvertise Jim, or something like that.  So we can’t resk being as long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdigging him out as we ought to.  By rights I reckon we ought to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta couple of years; but we can’t.  Things being so uncertain, what I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trecommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthirty-seven years.  Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst time there’s an alarm.  Yes, I reckon that ‘ll be the best way.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, there’s _sense_ in that,” I says.  “Letting on don’t cost nothing;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tletting on ain’t no trouble; and if it’s any object, I don’t mind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tletting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.  It wouldn’t strain
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme none, after I got my hand in.  So I’ll mosey along now, and smouch a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of case-knives.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make a saw out of.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, if it ain’t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,” I says,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“there’s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tweather-boarding behind the smoke-house.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.  Run along and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsmouch the knives--three of them.”  So I done it.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXVI.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most to the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe’d done anything hardly.  At last I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom Sawyer.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdigging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work.  If we was prisoners
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would, because then we’d have as many years as we wanted, and no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t get blistered, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the way it ought to be done.  But _we_ can’t fool along; we got to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trush; we ain’t got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnight this way we’d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell--couldn’t touch a case-knife with them sooner.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll tell you.  It ain’t right, and it ain’t moral, and I wouldn’t like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit to get out; but there ain’t only just the one way:  we got to dig him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout with the picks, and _let on_ it’s case-knives.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Now_ you’re _talking_!”  I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says.  “Picks is the thing, moral or no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmoral; and as for me, I don’t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbook, I ain’t no ways particular how it’s done so it’s done.  What I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiest thing, that’s the thing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbook out with; and I don’t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it nuther.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t approve of it, nor I wouldn’t stand by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a body ain’t got no business doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_without_ any letting on, because you don’t know no better; but it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t for me, because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gimme a _case-knife_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI didn’t know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tamongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit and went to work, and never said a word.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was always just that particular.  Full of principle.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlong as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn’t come it, his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thands was so sore.  At last he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t no use, it can’t be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou think of no way?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular.  Come up the stairs, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlet on it’s a lightning-rod.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he done it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplates.  Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t ever see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in the dog-fennel
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no need to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdecide on any of them yet.  Said we’d got to post Jim first.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him.  Then we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe job was done.  We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thoney, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tunregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We’ll send you some things by them.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI said, “Don’t do nothing of the kind; it’s one of the most jackass
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to me; went right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton.  It was his way when he’d got his plans set.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he told Jim how we’d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlarge things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe would put small things in uncle’s coat-pockets and he must steal them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout; and we would tie things to aunt’s apron-strings or put them in her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tapron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn’t see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas Tom said.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed, with hands that looked like they’d been chawed.  Tom was in high
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmost intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkeep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIn the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcorn-pone that was in Jim’s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmashed all his teeth out; and there warn’t ever anything could a worked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust a piece of rock or something like that that’s always getting into
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim’s bed; and they kept on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpiling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn’t hardly room
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoor!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches” once, and keeled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim’s meat,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain and shut the door, and I knowed he’d fixed the other door too.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tasking him if he’d been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand blinked his eyes around, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mars Sid, you’ll say I’s a fool, but if I didn’t b’lieve I see most a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmillion dogs, er devils, er some’n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttracks.  I did, mos’ sholy.  Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas all over me.  Dad fetch it, I jis’ wisht I could git my han’s on one

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI wisht dey’d lemme ‘lone, I does.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I tell you what I think.  What makes them come here just at this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trunaway nigger’s breakfast-time?  It’s because they’re hungry; that’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe reason.  You make them a witch pie; that’s the thing for _you_ to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But my lan’, Mars Sid, how’s I gwyne to make ‘m a witch pie?  I doan’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow how to make it.  I hain’t ever hearn er sich a thing b’fo’.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, I’ll have to make it myself.”

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, I’ll do it, seeing it’s you, and you’ve been good to us and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshowed us the runaway nigger.  But you got to be mighty careful.  When
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we’ve put in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpan, don’t you let on you see it at all.  And don’t you look when Jim

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXVII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHAT was all fixed.  So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSally’s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t’other we stuck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the band of Uncle Silas’s hat, which was on the bureau, because we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thouse this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpewter spoon in Uncle Silas’s coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn’t come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyet, so we had to wait a little while.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn’t hardly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thand and cracking the handiest child’s head with her thimble with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ve hunted high and I’ve hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecome of your other shirt.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMy heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpiece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troad with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor half price if there was a bidder.  But after that we was all right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tUncle Silas he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s most uncommon curious, I can’t understand it.  I know perfectly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell I took it _off_, because--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because you hain’t got but one _on_.  Just _listen_ at the man!  I know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmemory, too, because it was on the clo’s-line yesterday--I see it there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself. But it’s gone, that’s the long and the short of it, and you’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust have to change to a red flann’l one till I can get time to make a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnew one. And it ‘ll be the third I’ve made in two years.  It just keeps
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_do_ with ‘m all is more’n I can make out.  A body ‘d think you _would_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlearn to take some sort of care of ‘em at your time of life.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.  But it oughtn’t to be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taltogether my fault, because, you know, I don’t see them nor have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to do with them except when they’re on me; and I don’t believe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ve ever lost one of them _off_ of me.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it ain’t _your_ fault if you haven’t, Silas; you’d a done it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif you could, I reckon.  And the shirt ain’t all that’s gone, nuther.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Ther’s a spoon gone; and _that_ ain’t all.  There was ten, and now
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tther’s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook the spoon, _that’s_ certain.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, what else is gone, Sally?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ther’s six _candles_ gone--that’s what.  The rats could a got the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don’t walk off with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhole place, the way you’re always going to stop their holes and don’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo it; and if they warn’t fools they’d sleep in your hair, Silas--_you’d_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever find it out; but you can’t lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Sally, I’m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I’ve been remiss; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI won’t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I wouldn’t hurry; next year ‘ll do.  Matilda Angelina Araminta
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_Phelps!_”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsugar-bowl without fooling around any.  Just then the nigger woman steps
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton to the passage, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Missus, dey’s a sheet gone.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A _sheet_ gone!  Well, for the land’s sake!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll stop up them holes to-day,” says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, _do_ shet up!--s’pose the rats took the _sheet_?  _where’s_ it gone,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLize?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Clah to goodness I hain’t no notion, Miss’ Sally.  She wuz on de
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tclo’sline yistiddy, but she done gone:  she ain’ dah no mo’ now.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end.  I _never_ see the beat of it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin all my born days.  A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Missus,” comes a young yaller wench, “dey’s a brass cannelstick
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmiss’n.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cler out from here, you hussy, er I’ll take a skillet to ye!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, she was just a-biling.  I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.  She
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket.  She stopped,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s _just_ as I expected.  So you had it in your pocket all the time;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand like as not you’ve got the other things there, too.  How’d it get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reely don’t know, Sally,” he says, kind of apologizing, “or you know
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI would tell.  I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain’t in; but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I’ll know I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook up the spoon, and--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, for the land’s sake!  Give a body a rest!  Go ‘long now, the whole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkit and biling of ye; and don’t come nigh me again till I’ve got back my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpeace of mind.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI’D a heard her if she’d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout; and I’d a got up and obeyed her if I’d a been dead.  As we was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpassing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.  Tom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it ain’t no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treliable.” Then he says:  “But he done us a good turn with the spoon,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway, without knowing it, and so we’ll go and do him one without _him_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowing it--stop up his rat-holes.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.  Then we heard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsteps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t’other,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooking as absent-minded as year before last.  He went a mooning around,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst to one rat-hole and then another, till he’d been to them all.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand thinking.  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaying:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, for the life of me I can’t remember when I done it.  I could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshow her now that I warn’t to blame on account of the rats.  But never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmind--let it go.  I reckon it wouldn’t do no good.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.  He was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty nice old man.  And always is.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe’d got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had ciphered it out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcounting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem up my sleeve, and Tom says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain’t but nine spoons _yet_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Go ‘long to your play, and don’t bother me.  I know better, I counted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘m myself.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can’t make but nine.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tShe looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I declare to gracious ther’ _ain’t_ but nine!” she says.  “Why, what in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe world--plague _take_ the things, I’ll count ‘m again.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther’s _ten_ now!” and she looked huffy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand bothered both.  But Tom says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Aunty, I don’t think there’s ten.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You numskull, didn’t you see me _count ‘m?_”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know, but--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ll count ‘m _again_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she’d start
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgalley-west; and she said cle’r out and let her have some peace, and if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she’d skin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthis business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause he said _now_ she couldn’t ever count them spoons twice alike
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain to save her life; and wouldn’t believe she’d counted them right if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe _did_; and said that after she’d about counted her head off for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnext three days he judged she’d give it up and offer to kill anybody
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat wanted her to ever count them any more.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of days till she didn’t know how many sheets she had any more,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand she didn’t _care_, and warn’t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoul out about it, and wouldn’t count them again not to save her life;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe druther die first.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcounting; and as to the candlestick, it warn’t no consequence, it would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tblow over by and by.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe smoke; because, you see, we didn’t want nothing but a crust, and we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith.  We let on it took nine months to make it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn’t go
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough for forty pies if we’d a wanted them, and plenty left over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a whole
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdinner.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut we didn’t need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso we throwed the rest away.  We didn’t cook none of the pies in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tEngland with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpies, because we didn’t know how, but she come up smiling on the last
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone.  We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twant to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tladder wouldn’t cramp him down to business I don’t know nothing what I’m
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttalking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, too.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNat didn’t look when we put the witch pie in Jim’s pan; and we put the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthree tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twindow-hole.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXVIII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tallowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.  That’s the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.  But he had to have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit; Tom said he’d _got_ to; there warn’t no case of a state prisoner not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford Dudley; look at old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNorthumberland!  Why, Huck, s’pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou going to do?--how you going to get around it?  Jim’s _got_ to do his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinscription and coat of arms.  They all do.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coat o’ arm; I hain’t got nuffn but dish
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, you don’t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” I says, “Jim’s right, anyway, when he says he ain’t got no coat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof arms, because he hain’t.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he’ll have one before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the goes out of this--because he’s going out _right_, and there ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to be no flaws in his record.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom set to work to think out the coat of arms.  By and by he said he’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstruck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas one which he reckoned he’d decide on.  He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tFretta, Minore Otto._  Got it out of a book--means the more haste the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tless speed.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says; “we got to dig in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike all git-out.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s _some_ of it?  What’s a fess?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“A fess--a fess is--_you_ don’t need to know what a fess is.  I’ll show
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim how to make it when he gets to it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person.  What’s a bar
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsinister?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I don’t know.  But he’s got to have it.  All the nobility does.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThat was just his way.  If it didn’t suit him to explain a thing to you,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the wouldn’t do it.  You might pump at him a week, it wouldn’t make no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdifference.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfinish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done.  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t1.  Here a captive heart busted. 2.  Here a poor prisoner, forsook by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.  Here a lonely
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyears of solitary captivity. 4.  Here, homeless and friendless, after
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnatural son of Louis XIV.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen he got done he couldn’t no way make up his mind which one for Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would let him scrabble them all on.  Jim said it would take him a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyear to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem out for him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing to do but just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfollow the lines.  Then pretty soon he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t have log walls
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.  We’ll fetch
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta rock.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever get out.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t But Tom said he would let me help him do it.  Then he took a look to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee how me and Jim was getting along with the pens.  It was most pesky
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttedious hard work and slow, and didn’t give my hands no show to get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twell of the sores, and we didn’t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know how to fix it.  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThere’s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll smouch it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIt warn’t no slouch of an idea; and it warn’t no slouch of a grindstone
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnuther; but we allowed we’d tackle it.  It warn’t quite midnight yet,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.  We smouched the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjob. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn’t keep her from falling
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee it warn’t no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom superintended.  He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.  He
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknowed how to do everything.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tOur hole was pretty big, but it warn’t big enough to get the grindstone
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.  Then Tom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmarked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tquit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this straw tick and sleep on it.  Then we helped him fix his chain back
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  But Tom thought of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You got any spiders in here, Jim?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain’t, Mars Tom.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, we’ll get you some.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But bless you, honey, I doan’ _want_ none.  I’s afeard un um.  I jis’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t‘s soon have rattlesnakes aroun’.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom thought a minute or two, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a good idea.  And I reckon it’s been done.  It _must_ a been done;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit stands to reason.  Yes, it’s a prime good idea.  Where could you keep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Keep what, Mars Tom?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, a rattlesnake.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome in heah I’d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy head.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Jim, you wouldn’t be afraid of it after a little.  You could tame
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Tame_ it!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--easy enough.  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they wouldn’t _think_ of hurting a person that pets them.  Any book
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill tell you that.  You try--that’s all I ask; just try for two or three
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdays. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he’ll love you;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand sleep with you; and won’t stay away from you a minute; and will let
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_’ talk so!  I can’t _stan_’ it!  He’d _let_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme shove his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain’t it?  I lay he’d wait a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpow’ful long time ‘fo’ I _ast_ him.  En mo’ en dat, I doan’ _want_ him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto sleep wid me.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Jim, don’t act so foolish.  A prisoner’s _got_ to have some kind of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain’t ever been tried, why, there’s more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tglory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway you could ever think of to save your life.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ _want_ no sich glory.  Snake take ‘n bite
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim’s chin off, den _whah_ is de glory?  No, sah, I doan’ want no sich
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoin’s.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, can’t you _try_?  I only _want_ you to try--you needn’t keep
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit up if it don’t work.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I’s a tryin’ him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMars Tom, I’s willin’ to tackle mos’ anything ‘at ain’t onreasonable,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgwyne to _leave_, dat’s _shore_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you’re so bull-headed about it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir tails, and let on they’re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that ‘ll have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto do.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I k’n stan’ _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame’ ‘f I couldn’ get along widout
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tum, I tell you dat.  I never knowed b’fo’ ‘t was so much bother and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrouble to be a prisoner.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it _always_ is when it’s done right.  You got any rats around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sah, I hain’t seed none.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, we’ll get you some rats.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ _want_ no rats.  Dey’s de dadblamedest creturs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto ‘sturb a body, en rustle roun’ over ‘im, en bite his feet, when he’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttryin’ to sleep, I ever see.  No, sah, gimme g’yarter-snakes, ‘f I’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to have ‘m, but doan’ gimme no rats; I hain’ got no use f’r um,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tskasely.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But, Jim, you _got_ to have ‘em--they all do.  So don’t make no more
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfuss about it.  Prisoners ain’t ever without rats.  There ain’t no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinstance of it.  And they train them, and pet them, and learn them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.  But you got to play
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmusic to them.  You got anything to play music on?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I ain’ got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o’ paper, en a juice-harp;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut I reck’n dey wouldn’ take no stock in a juice-harp.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes they would _they_ don’t care what kind of music ‘tis.  A
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjews-harp’s plenty good enough for a rat.  All animals like music--in a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprison they dote on it.  Specially, painful music; and you can’t get no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother kind out of a jews-harp.  It always interests them; they come out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto see what’s the matter with you.  Yes, you’re all right; you’re fixed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery well.  You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play ‘The Last Link
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis Broken’--that’s the thing that ‘ll scoop a rat quicker ‘n anything
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\telse; and when you’ve played about two minutes you’ll see all the rats,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand come.  And they’ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, _dey_ will, I reck’n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thavin’? Blest if I kin see de pint.  But I’ll do it ef I got to.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treck’n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thouse.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn’t nothing else; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty soon he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, there’s one thing I forgot.  Could you raise a flower here, do you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\treckon?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it’s tolable dark in heah,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ten I ain’ got no use f’r no flower, nohow, en she’d be a pow’ful sight
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’ trouble.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you try it, anyway.  Some other prisoners has done it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“One er dem big cat-tail-lookin’ mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom, I reck’n, but she wouldn’t be wuth half de trouble she’d coss.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you believe it.  We’ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe corner over there, and raise it.  And don’t call it mullen, call it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tPitchiola--that’s its right name when it’s in a prison.  And you want to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twater it with your tears.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You don’t _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t It’s the way they always do.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspring water whiles another man’s a _start’n_ one wid tears.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That ain’t the idea.  You _got_ to do it with tears.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“She’ll die on my han’s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan’ skasely
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever cry.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Tom was stumped.  But he studied it over, and then said Jim would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave to worry along the best he could with an onion.  He promised
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcoffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would “jis’ ‘s soon have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it, and with the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twork and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpetting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbe a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpatience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them, and they was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjust about wasted on him.  So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXIX.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit in a safe place under Aunt Sally’s bed.  But while we was gone for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dusted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanother fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcaterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnest, but we didn’t.  The family was at home.  We didn’t give it right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttire them out or they’d got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, but couldn’t set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta rattling good honest day’s work:  and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t And there warn’t a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmatter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.  So
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn’t no real
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tscarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.  You’d see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgenerly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the time where you didn’t want them.  Well, they was handsome and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstriped, and there warn’t no harm in a million of them; but that never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmade no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey might, and she couldn’t stand them no way you could fix it; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tevery time one of them flopped down on her, it didn’t make no difference
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thowl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman so that he said he could most wish there hadn’t ever been no snakes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcreated.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thouse for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn’t over it yet; she warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnear over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttouch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twomen was just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tother.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tallowed these lickings warn’t nothing to what she would do if we ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloaded up the place again with them.  I didn’t mind the lickings,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause they didn’t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim’s was when they’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn’t like the spiders,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the spiders didn’t like Jim; and so they’d lay for him, and make it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the grindstone there warn’t no room in bed for him, skasely; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen there was, a body couldn’t sleep, it was so lively, and it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talways lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttook turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgang under him, in his way, and t’other gang having a circus over him,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgrindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to die, but didn’t.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee; and Tom said the same.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut as I was saying, we’d got all the work done now, at last; and we was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The old man had wrote
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trunaway nigger, but hadn’t got no answer, because there warn’t no such
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNew Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe cold shivers, and I see we hadn’t no time to lose. So Tom said, now
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the nonnamous letters.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s them?”  I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it’s done one
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, sometimes another.  But there’s always somebody spying around that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It’s a very good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We’ll use them both.  And it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tusual for the prisoner’s mother to change clothes with him, and she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstays in, and he slides out in her clothes.  We’ll do that, too.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething’s up?  Let them find it out for themselves--it’s their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlookout.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I know; but you can’t depend on them.  It’s the way they’ve acted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the very start--left us to do _everything_.  They’re so confiding
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand mullet-headed they don’t take notice of nothing at all.  So if we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t _give_ them notice there won’t be nobody nor nothing to interfere
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ‘ll go
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toff perfectly flat; won’t amount to nothing--won’t be nothing _to_ it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, as for me, Tom, that’s the way I’d like.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“But I ain’t going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme. What you going to do about the servant-girl?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’ll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyaller girl’s frock.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Tom, that ‘ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprob’bly hain’t got any but that one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know; but you don’t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, then, I’ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\town togs.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You wouldn’t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, but there won’t be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“That ain’t got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot. Hain’t you got no principle at all?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, I ain’t saying nothing; I’m the servant-girl.  Who’s Jim’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmother?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m his mother.  I’ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, you’ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Not much.  I’ll stuff Jim’s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto represent his mother in disguise, and Jim ‘ll take the nigger woman’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgown off of me and wear it, and we’ll all evade together.  When a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprisoner of style escapes it’s called an evasion.  It’s always called
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tso when a king escapes, f’rinstance.  And the same with a king’s son;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit don’t make no difference whether he’s a natural one or an unnatural
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tone.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfrock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway Tom told me to.  It said:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBeware.  Trouble is brewing.  Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe back door.  I never see a family in such a sweat.  They couldn’t a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbehind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.  If
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said “ouch!” if anything fell,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe jumped and said “ouch!” if you happened to touch her, when she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t noticing, she done the same; she couldn’t face noway and be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying “ouch,” and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore she’d got two-thirds around she’d whirl back again, and say it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn’t set up.  So the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmore satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstreak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.  This letter
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tDon’t betray me, I wish to be your friend.  There is a desprate gang of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstay in the house and not bother them.  I am one of the gang, but have
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger’s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tif I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tchains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tleasure.  Don’t do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tany reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XL.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlook at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand found them in such a sweat and worry they didn’t know which end they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsupper, and wouldn’t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tword about the new letter, but didn’t need to, because we knowed as much
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thalf-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally’s dress that he stole and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas going to start with the lunch, but says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where’s the butter?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a corn-pone.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain’t here.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We can get along without it,” I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“We can get along _with_ it, too,” he says; “just you slide down cellar
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand fetch it.  And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong. I’ll go and stuff the straw into Jim’s clothes to represent his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou get there.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta person’s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcorn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmy hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You been down cellar?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What you been doing down there?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Noth’n.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Noth’n!_”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know ‘m.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You don’t _know_?  Don’t answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou been _doing_ down there.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI reckoned she’d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ts’pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout every little thing that warn’t yard-stick straight; so she says,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tvery decided:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.  You
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen up to something you no business to, and I lay I’ll find out what it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tis before I’M done with you.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMy, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn’t;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn’t easy myself, but I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t take my hat off, all the same.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we’d overdone this
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthing, and what a thundering hornet’s-nest we’d got ourselves into, so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthese rips got out of patience and come for us.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAt last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn’t_ answer
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem straight, I didn’t know which end of me was up; because these men
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn’t but a few minutes to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon, when one of them says, “I’M for going and getting in the cabin
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,” I most
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“For the land’s sake, what _is_ the matter with the child?  He’s got the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbrain-fever as shore as you’re born, and they’re oozing out!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thugged me, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t no worse; for luck’s against us, and it never rains but it pours,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand when I see that truck I thought we’d lost you, for I knowed by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdear, whyd’nt you _tell_ me that was what you’d been down there for, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t a cared.  Now cler out to bed, and don’t lemme see no more of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou till morning!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I couldn’t hardly get my
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twords out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith guns!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHis eyes just blazed; and he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No!--is that so?  _ain’t_ it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was to do over
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could put it off till--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hurry!  _Hurry_!”  I says.  “Where’s Jim?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He’s dressed, and everything’s ready.  Now we’ll slide out and give the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsheep-signal.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbegin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I _told_ you we’d be too soon; they haven’t come--the door is locked.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHere, I’ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for ‘em in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdark and kill ‘em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand listen if you can hear ‘em coming.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo in they come, but couldn’t see us in the dark, and most trod on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Tom last, which was according to Tom’s orders.  Now we was in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn’t make
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlistened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tover it; but Tom’s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsnapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand started somebody sings out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’s that?  Answer, or I’ll shoot!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut we didn’t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround us! We heard them sing out:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here they are!  They’ve broke for the river!  After ‘em, boys, and turn
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tloose the dogs!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they wore
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboots and yelled, but we didn’t wear no boots and didn’t yell.  We was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem.  They’d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn’t scare off the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trobbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thowdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthen we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\triver, but didn’t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstruck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.  And when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe stepped on to the raft I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Now_, old Jim, you’re a free man again, and I bet you won’t ever be a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslave no more.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It ‘uz planned beautiful, en
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit ‘uz done beautiful; en dey ain’t _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat’s mo’
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the had a bullet in the calf of his leg.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen me and Jim heard that we didn’t feel so brash as what we did
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wigwam and tore up one of the duke’s shirts for to bandage him, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don’t stop now; don’t fool around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\there, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ther loose!  Boys, we done it elegant!--‘deed we did.  I wish _we’d_ a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn’t a been no ‘Son of Saint
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLouis, ascend to heaven!’ wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta whooped him over the _border_--that’s what we’d a done with _him_--and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdone it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  Man the sweeps--man the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweeps!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut me and Jim was consulting--and thinking.  And after we’d thought a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute, I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say it, Jim.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz _him_ dat ‘uz
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbein’ sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, ‘Go on
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ten save me, nemmine ‘bout a doctor f’r to save dis one?’  Is dat like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tMars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You _bet_ he wouldn’t!  _well_,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tden, is _Jim_ gywne to say it?  No, sah--I doan’ budge a step out’n dis
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplace ‘dout a _doctor_, not if it’s forty year!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he’d say what he did say--so
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twouldn’t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thimself; but we wouldn’t let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbut it didn’t do no good.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, if you’re bound to go, I’ll tell you the way to do when you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfull of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcanoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this chalk away from him, and don’t give it back to him till you get him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tback to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tagain. It’s the way they all do.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee the doctor coming till he was gone again.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XLI.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnot say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome home this evening and surprise the folks.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who is your folks?” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The Phelpses, down yonder.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh,” he says.  And after a minute, he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“How’d you say he got shot?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He had a dream,” I says, “and it shot him.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Singular dream,” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he sees the canoe he didn’t like the look of her--said she was big
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough for one, but didn’t look pretty safe for two.  I says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, you needn’t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What three?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that’s what I mean.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh,” he says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand said he reckoned he’d look around for a bigger one.  But they was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttill he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI said I didn’t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos’n he can’t fix
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat leg just in three shakes of a sheep’s tail, as the saying is?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tspos’n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--lay
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_I’ll_ do.  I’ll wait, and when he comes back if he says he’s got to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo any more I’ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we’ll take and tie
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom’s done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith him we’ll give him what it’s worth, or all we got, and then let him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tget ashore.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twaked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and went for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoctor’s house, but they told me he’d gone away in the night some time
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tor other, and warn’t back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor Tom, and I’ll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstomach! He says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, _Tom!_  Where you been all this time, you rascal?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hain’t been nowheres,” I says, “only just hunting for the runaway
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger--me and Sid.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, where ever did you go?” he says.  “Your aunt’s been mighty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tuneasy.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“She needn’t,” I says, “because we was all right.  We followed the men
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcrossed over, but couldn’t find nothing of them; so we cruised along
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpaddled over here to hear the news, and Sid’s at the post-office to see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhat he can hear, and I’m a-branching out to get something to eat for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tus, and then we’re going home.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo then we went to the post-office to get “Sid”; but just as I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsuspicioned, he warn’t there; so the old man he got a letter out of the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toffice, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn’t come; so the old man
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfooling around--but we would ride.  I couldn’t get him to let me stay
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand wait for Sid; and he said there warn’t no use in it, and I must come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t amount to shucks, and said she’d serve Sid the same when he come.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd the place was plum full of farmers and farmers’ wives, to dinner;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworst; her tongue was a-going all the time.  She says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Sister Phelps, I’ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an’ I b’lieve
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe nigger was crazy.  I says to Sister Damrell--didn’t I, Sister

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlit on me--I got up and took a walk.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSays I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\troom this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t So I done it.  But I dasn’t go fur, or she’d a sent for me.  And when
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttold her the noise and shooting waked up me and “Sid,” and the door was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlocked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand both of us got hurt a little, and we didn’t never want to try _that_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tno more.  And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore; and then she said she’d forgive us, and maybe it was all right
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tas no harm hadn’t come of it, she judged she better put in her time
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbeing grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfretting over what was past and done.  So then she kissed me, and patted
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon jumps up, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, lawsamercy, it’s most night, and Sid not come yet!  What _has_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecome of that boy?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see my chance; so I skips up and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll run right up to town and get him,” I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No you won’t,” she says.  “You’ll stay right wher’ you are; _one’s_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tenough to be lost at a time.  If he ain’t here to supper, your uncle ‘ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, he warn’t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHe come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn’t run across Tom’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrack. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthere warn’t no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you’ll
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.  So she had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto be satisfied.  But she said she’d set up for him a while anyway, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tkeep a light burning so he could see it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI couldn’t look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tseem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsilent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgood, and she was in so much trouble.  And when she was going away she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The door ain’t going to be locked, Tom, and there’s the window and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe rod; but you’ll be good, _won’t_ you?  And you won’t go?  For _my_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsake.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tLaws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tintending to go; but after that I wouldn’t a went, not for kingdoms.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfront, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething for her, but I couldn’t, only to swear that I wouldn’t never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdo nothing to grieve her any more.  And the third time I waked up at
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.

AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XLII.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn’t get no
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttrack of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teating anything. And by and by the old man says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did I give you the letter?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What letter?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, you didn’t give me no letter.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I must a forgot it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  She says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, it’s from St. Petersburg--it’s from Sis.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn’t stir.  But
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdoctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand a lot of people.  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thandy, and rushed.  She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, he’s dead, he’s dead, I know he’s dead!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhich showed he warn’t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He’s alive, thank God!  And that’s enough!” and she snatched a kiss of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould go, every jump of the way.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\told doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.  The men
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall the other niggers around there, so they wouldn’t be trying to run
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhole family scared most to death for days and nights.  But the others
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, don’t do it, it wouldn’t answer at all; he ain’t our nigger, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem down a little, because the people that’s always the most anxious
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor to hang a nigger that hain’t done just right is always the very
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tones that ain’t the most anxious to pay for him when they’ve got their
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfaction out of him.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThey cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thead once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tboth legs, and said he warn’t to have nothing but bread and water to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the didn’t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttakes a look, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t be no rougher on him than you’re obleeged to, because he ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta bad nigger.  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn’t cut
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bullet out without some help, and he warn’t in no condition for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tworse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn’t let
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he’d kill
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn’t do
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\the’ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tjudged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  It
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof course I’d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause the nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yet
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnever a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stick
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tplumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been worked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tmain hard lately.  I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too.  I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thad everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_was_, with both of ‘m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tup on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tabout, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tflighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttowed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trow nor said a word from the start.  He ain’t no bad nigger, gentlemen;
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s what I think about him.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSomebody says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I’m obleeged to say.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taccording to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand hearty, that they wouldn’t cuss him no more.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tThen they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcould have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\theavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t think of it, and I reckoned it warn’t best for me to mix in, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI judged I’d get the doctor’s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsoon as I’d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twhen I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taround hunting the runaway nigger.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tNext morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSally was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room, and if I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfound him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twould wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tin, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tset down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he’d been sleeping
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlike that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, and ten to one he’d wake up in his right mind.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\teyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello!--why, I’m at _home_!  How’s that?  Where’s the raft?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s all right,” I says.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“And _Jim_?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“The same,” I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash.  But he never
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnoticed, but says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good!  Splendid!  _Now_ we’re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  “About what, Sid?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What whole thing?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, _the_ whole thing.  There ain’t but one; how we set the runaway
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger free--me and Tom.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good land!  Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about!  Dear, dear,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout of his head again!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_No_, I ain’t out of my _head_; I know all what I’m talking about.  We
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_did_ set him free--me and Tom.  We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t And we done it elegant, too.”  He’d got a start, and she never checked
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI see it warn’t no use for _me_ to put in.  “Why, Aunty, it cost us a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tpower of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twarming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand you can’t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tinscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can’t think _half_ the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfun it was.  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tlightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twith in your apron pocket--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mercy sakes!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdrive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthem go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us, but
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twent for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tourselves, and _wasn’t_ it bully, Aunty!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  So it was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_you_, you little rapscallions, that’s been making all this trouble,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand turned everybody’s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdeath.  I’ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\to’ you this very minute.  To think, here I’ve been, night after night,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I’ll tan the Old
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tHarry out o’ both o’ ye!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn’t_ hold in,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talong, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsays:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ttell you if I catch you meddling with him again--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Meddling with _who_?”  Tom says, dropping his smile and looking
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsurprised.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“With _who_?  Why, the runaway nigger, of course.  Who’d you reckon?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom looks at me very grave, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, didn’t you just tell me he was all right?  Hasn’t he got away?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Him_?” says Aunt Sally; “the runaway nigger?  ‘Deed he hasn’t.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t They’ve got him back, safe and sound, and he’s in that cabin again,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ton bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he’s claimed or
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsold!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand shutting like gills, and sings out to me:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They hain’t no _right_ to shut him up!  SHOVE!--and don’t you lose a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tminute.  Turn him loose! he ain’t no slave; he’s as free as any cretur
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthat walks this earth!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What _does_ the child mean?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don’t go, _I’ll_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgo. I’ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.  Old Miss
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWatson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twill.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\talready free?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women!  Why,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I’d a waded neck-deep in blood
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tto--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tIf she warn’t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  And I peeped
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tout, and in a little while Tom’s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tstood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim into the earth, you know.  And then she says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, you _better_ turn y’r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally; “_Is_ he changed so?  Why, that ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_Tom_, it’s Sid; Tom’s--Tom’s--why, where is Tom?  He was here a minute
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tago.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You mean where’s Huck _Finn_--that’s what you mean!  I reckon I hain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\traised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_see_ him.  That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tbed, Huck Finn.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSo I done it.  But not feeling brash.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsee--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit all to him.  It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tknow nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\toldest man in the world couldn’t a understood it.  So Tom’s Aunt Polly,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tshe told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer--she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I’m
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tused to it now, and ‘tain’t no need to change”--that when Aunt Sally took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tme for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn’t no other way, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta mystery, and he’d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied.  And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthings as soft as he could for me.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thelp a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go off that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tway without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go and trapse all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcreetur’s up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn’t seem to get any
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tanswer out of you about it.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I never heard nothing from you,” says Aunt Sally.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I wonder!  Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tby Sid being here.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I never got ‘em, Sis.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“You, Tom!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well--_what_?” he says, kind of pettish.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“What letters?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Them_ letters.  I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I’ll--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“They’re in the trunk.  There, now.  And they’re just the same as they
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas when I got them out of the office.  I hain’t looked into them, I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thain’t touched them.  But I knowed they’d make trouble, and I thought if
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tyou warn’t in no hurry, I’d--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain’t no mistake about it.  And I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s’pose he--”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, it come yesterday; I hain’t read it yet, but _it’s_ all right, I’ve
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tgot that one.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn’t, but I reckoned maybe it
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twas just as safe to not to.  So I never said nothing.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER THE LAST
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tof the evasion?--what it was he’d planned to do if the evasion worked all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tright and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thave adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\this being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthe niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tprocession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twe.  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tWe had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tSilas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tthey made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tall he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  And we had
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thim up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tislan’?  I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas’, en what’s de sign un it; en
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it’s
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome true; en heah she is!  _dah_, now! doan’ talk to _me_--signs is
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis’ ‘s well ‘at I ‘uz gwineter be
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\trich agin as I’s a-stannin’ heah dis minute!”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le’s all three
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tslide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\thowling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcouple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn’t get
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnone from home, because it’s likely pap’s been back before now, and got
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tit all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, he hain’t,” Tom says; “it’s all there yet--six thousand dollars
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tand more; and your pap hain’t ever been back since.  Hadn’t when I come
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\taway, anyhow.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tJim says, kind of solemn:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“He ain’t a-comin’ back no mo’, Huck.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tI says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Jim?”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain’t comin’ back no mo.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tBut I kept at him; so at last he says:
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t“Doan’ you ‘member de house dat was float’n down de river, en dey wuz a
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tman in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn’ let you
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tcome in?  Well, den, you kin git yo’ money when you wants it, kase dat
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\twuz him.”
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain’t
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I’d
AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinnByMarkTwain.txt\ta knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn’t a tackled it,
